        "content": "<p>\n\tIn 2021, at COP 26, India announced that it will meet 50 percent of its energy requirements from renewable energy and will be net zero by 2070.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe non-fossil target for 2030 has been set at 500 GW, which may include around 140 GW of wind, 70 GW of hydro (large and small) and 300 GW of solar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Minerals like chromium, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements or REEs are key to reaching the net zero goal and put India on a path to sustainable economic growth, noted Sunil Duggal, CII national committee chairman on mining &amp; group CEO, Vedanta Ltd at a panel discussion in IMME and Global Mining Summit on Wednesday.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tHowever, India has fewer identified resources and reserves of critical minerals as priority was given to the exploration of major and bulk minerals in the past, he added.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The significance of critical metals and minerals, including rare earths, is obvious from their core position in the manufacturing of items from photo voltaic cells, wind turbines, EVs, noted Duggal.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>For instance, an EV requires six times more mineral input than a conventional car, while onshore wind requires nine times more mineral than a gas-fired plant, he pointed out.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, the clean energy transition is going to be mineral intensive implying a significant rise in demand for critical minerals, he underscored.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Duggal opined that the progress on a clean energy future may become slower or costlier. &ldquo;To just meet the projected demand in 2030 in STEP (State Policies Scenario), additional 30 lithium mines, 41 nickel mines, and 11 cobalt mines are needed in 2030,&rdquo; he noted.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Production in all stages of the EV battery supply chain is highly concentrated geographically with China dominating the entire downstream EV battery supply chain, he said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tLack of focus on the exploration and mining of deep-seated and critical minerals has made India highly dependent on imports</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Deep Seated Minerals (DSM), including copper, lithium, cobalt, and other non-bulk ores, constituted 14 percent of India&rsquo;s total imports, according to Ministry of Commerce and Industry estimates.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>In 2021, the total value of DSM imported stood at $3.5 billion, which is expected to swell to $12 billion.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe import value of DSM and CM in 2021 was $86 billion but with the exponential rise in demand, this is estimated to multiply 3.2 times to $280 billion in 2030, the ministry data shows.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Ukraine War has reinforced the urgency to increase the share of renewable energy in the energy basket, said Rajesh Chadha, senior fellow CSEP.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe noted that the extended Covid-19 lockdown in China that created major supply chain hurdles should be a wake-up call for India to build up its resources.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Arvind Kumar, Director Technical, MECL, underlined how China dominates in clean energy metals and minerals. With huge resources of CMs, China controls 72 percent of the world&#39;s solar modules, 69 percent of lithium batteries, and 45 percent of wind turbines.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Being a leading producer, it also controls the refining of minerals that are critical for clean energy as well as stockpiling minerals like cobalt, lithium, neodymium and other rare earth to make powerful magnets for effective batteries, charged quickly.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tChina also dominates value chains across mining, processing and producing magnet and has a major role in the global supply chains of rare earths.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2010, China suspended exports of rare earth to Japan for almost two months. Recently it has passed a law requiring case-by-case scrutiny of the export of REE and other critical minerals.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe supply of these critical minerals can be disrupted easily due to trade wars, conflict or civil unrest, the panellists noted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>In the absence of processing and refining units for strategic minerals (except IREL), India can cover the gap with strategic acquisition of mines by its private or public sector companies in line with ONGC which has already acquired some oil and gas assets overseas, they said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tForming informal alliances of countries namely strategic minerals and metal producing countries like Australia, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Bolivia, and Africa and signing diplomatic and trade agreements for ensuring long-term availability.</p>\n<p>\n\tDevelopment of new methods for exploration and efficient extraction, and technology development for mining the so-called low-grade minerals as most of India&rsquo;s critical mineral resources come under this category.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The panellists also stressed on setting up of refining and processing units for critical minerals, &ldquo;Strategic Reserves for Critical Minerals&rdquo; in line with Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), incentives for recycling to extract critical minerals.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe panel appreciated government measures like mining sector reforms including auctioning of the mineral blocks, 100 percent FDI in mining, encouraging notified exploration agencies for exploration of critical minerals, setting up of Khanij Bidesh India Limited (KABIL) for acquisition, exploration, mining and processing of strategic minerals in foreign lands among others.</p>"

Second, they allow policyholders to meet their future goals, such as accumulating funds for retirement. They are becoming increasingly popular as they provide stable income and help individuals meet their financial objectives.</p>\n<p>\n\tHere are 5 reasons why you should consider investing in guaranteed income plans-</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>Help You Build a Guaranteed Income Stream</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tBeing able to generate a regular income stream is an important part of retirement planning. This is because it means that you can provide yourself with a safety net in case of an emergency or other unexpected expenses. A regular source of income can help you keep your finances on track and avoid long-term financial problems down the road.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne key benefit that these plans provide is a regular income stream. Hence, it can help you maintain your financial independence. Thus, you don&rsquo;t need to be reliant on other family members for assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs guaranteed income plans can provide you with a stable source of income, they can make sure you don&rsquo;t run out of money when you retire.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany people choose guaranteed income plans because they want to get financial protection for life after retirement. They prefer guaranteed income plans because these plans can help them live off their savings for the rest of their life.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>Death Benefit</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tAs guaranteed income plans are a type of life insurance, most of them provide the death benefit. With a death benefit, you can leave your family with a valuable financial resource in the event of your untimely passing.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen purchasing a <a href=\"https://www.hdfclife.com/savings-plans/super-income-plan\">guaranteed income plan</a>, it&#39;s important to consider your own risk factors and the coverage you&#39;re looking for. Some factors to be aware of include marriage status, number of children, occupation, and medical history.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother benefit is having a dedicated income in place when your spouse or children need support for unforeseen circumstances like medical bills or unexpected expenses.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>Help You Meet Future Expenses</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tIt&#39;s important to plan ahead and make sure that you&#39;re prepared financially for future expenses. As you get older, the costs of things like health care, retirement, and daily living can become a significant drain on your finances. If you don&#39;t have a plan in place to cover these costs, then you could end up in serious financial trouble.</p>\n<p>\n\tIf you want to build a solid financial foundation for your later years, then it&#39;s essential to choose a good investment option. One such investment option are guaranteed income plans.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother important thing you should do is start investing early. The earlier you start, the more time there is to grow your money and ride out any bumps along the way. Furthermore, guaranteed income plans help build your savings, which can come in handy if unexpected expenses arise down the road. By planning ahead and putting aside money for the future, you&#39;ll be well on your way to a secure retirement.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>Helps You Avail Tax Benefits</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the most important benefits that guaranteed income plans provide are tax benefits. By investing in a guaranteed income plan, you can avail a tax deduction of up to Rs. 1.5 Lakh.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>Allows You to Diversify Your Portfolio</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tDiversification is the process of spreading your investment assets across multiple asset classes. The main goal of diversification is to reduce the risk of losing money by putting your money in different types of investments. Therefore, diversification can be viewed as an effective way to reduce overall portfolio risks and increase returns.</p>\n<p>\n\tThere are two main benefits to diversifying your investments-</p>\n<ul>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDiversification reduces the risk of losing money. A broad range of investments with different characteristics reduces the risk that a single investment will lose value at a faster rate than other investments in your portfolio.</li>\n\t<li>\n\t\tDiversification increases the probability that you will earn a positive return on your investments. If you invest in a wide range of investments, then it is more likely that at least one type will outperform the others and generate a positive return for your portfolio.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n\tWith guaranteed income plans, you can diversify your portfolio as it is a safe investment option. Hence, irrespective of the returns you gain from other investments, you can get a stable source of income with guaranteed income plans.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>Invest in a Guaranteed Income Plan for a Stable Retirement</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tA guaranteed income plan is an investment vehicle that provides regular payments to the policyholders.

        "publishedAt": "November 15, 2022",
        "content": "<p>\n\t<strong>How are your growth figures post the merger with Prestige?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWe started discussing a merger with Prestige in November 2021 and we announced it only in June when we inaugurated our Bengaluru experience centre. It has been only three-four months since we started using the brand name properly and that has resulted in huge changes in business, both on the franchisee side and the B2B side. Now, large businesses are much more confident to give us 100--200 kitchens.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How much revenue growth do you expect by 2025?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOur speed of growth is very high this year. We expect to gain market leadership in the next 18 to 24 months. As the industry is very unorganized, we don&#39;t know the exact number but it would be somewhere between 100 to 200 crores. By 2025, we are very confident about significant growth. Even during the pandemic, Ultrafresh grew 50 -60 percent year-on-year. We did not lose a single manpower though we didn&#39;t add a single store. There was no downsizing. In terms of revenue growth, at least for the next three years we will be able to grow 2 to 3 times. By 2025, we are looking at growing to Rs 500 crores in terms of the top line.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Is cross-marketing helping you?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIt&#39;s going great. It helps us in two ways. One--the ticket size of the customer goes up, and the same customer who is buying a kitchen from us is also now buying Prestige kitchen appliances like cooktops, chimneys, and OTG; two&mdash;increase in brand value--everyone knows the brand Prestige, every kitchen will have some Prestige product. Now when we go to customers, we don&#39;t have to explain who we are. We can straightaway talk about our products and services. From a brand perspective, immediately it has given us business and customer acquisition ticket size has started going up.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Do you have any plans to add more manufacturing units?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWe have a manufacturing unit in Himachal Pradesh in Baddi. Right now, we are at around 18 to 19 percent capacity utilisation of our factory. There won&rsquo;t be a need to add any more manufacturing capacity till 5x growth maybe. Probably after two or three years, we will add more Capex in the south as we will be serving the southwest and northeast more.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>In the south where do you plan to build a new manufacturing unit?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIt depends, as Prestige has over nine to ten factories in the south. One of the biggest things that have come on board with Prestige -- more than the business more than the brand -- is the know-how of the management. Their management gives us a lot of insights about how to work and which areas we need to focus on. We have autonomous control, so, no one interferes with how we run our business but wherever we need help we can go to them.</p>\n<p>\n\tBeing a young team, we don&#39;t have the experience of opening many factories or warehouses. So, it helps us a lot in terms of guidance. We wouldn&rsquo;t have to burn our own fingers experimenting with big capital investment. They have such big manufacturing setups that they know how to make profitable factories and we should be able to replicate them.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/finance_pic/2022/d0fd48bc6de92684246669c1228776b81.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Which regions are your biggest markets in India for you?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe east has already been a strong market for us for a while. The biggest processing currently is in the south because Prestige being a south India-based company, we are getting the leverage of that brand value in the south. So the South is growing the fastest. The next biggest growth is coming in the west zone.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How different is your new experience centre in Bengaluru&rsquo;s Koramangala from the existing ones?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe first 80-90 Ultrafresh stores came up between 2018 to 2021 in a certain format. After Prestige came on board, we have been looking at business synergy. So, all of our new stores that are opening are like our Bengaluru stores. It is not possible to fully revamp the old store because of space limitations, but we have rebranded them. If you go to those old stores now, it&#39;s &quot;Ultrafresh powered by Prestige&quot;. We have some 160 showrooms now and Prestige has 750. In all our 150 stores we are having Prestige products.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Are you collaborating with construction companies for modular kitchen installations in their projects like other home interior and renovation companies?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOur bread and butter is B2C, and sales come mostly through direct customer dealing. So far, we have done 5,000 kitchens and most of it has been to end customers. Earlier, we did not have a risk appetite. We were very sceptical and conservative to get our hands on that. Now that we are funded, we are more risk open to take up bigger projects. For example, we did a Rs 50 lakh project for the Indian Navy in Kolkata, a project for Reliance in Jamnagar for Rs 1.5 crore in the last quarter. We have picked up a Rs 200 crore kitchen order in Mumbai. We assume in future, 20 percent of our business will come from institutional and about 80 percent from end customers.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How affordable are Ultrafresh kitchens?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOur product range is slightly lower in the east. In terms of the average value, it is around 1.5 lakh to 2 lakh rupee kitchens here. Traditionally, across the country, it would be around 2.5 lakh to 3 lakh rupees our average kitchen price. We are positioning Ultrafresh modular kitchens somewhere between the carpenter and what other brands are giving. The perception that modular kitchens are very expensive for most people is wrong. A lot of our branding and advertising has to make people aware that modular kitchens are affordable and bring better value for money. To make our kitchens more accessible we have launched an EMI scheme with HDFC.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>What are your unique offerings?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOur steel kitchens are our unique offering, which make up 60 percent of our volume. Steel kitchen is a very different concept. Only Godrej and Ultrafresh are the two upscale brands that sell steel kitchens. Steel kitchens are more durable because of the termite problem in India and also the hot and humid weather. Against the common belief that steel kitchens are not aesthetically pleasing, we have taken steel kitchens aesthetically to the level of wooden kitchens. There is a huge demand for steel kitchens in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How well do you think the modular kitchen market is likely to grow?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tRight now in India, less than one out of every 100 kitchens that is made here, is a factory-made kitchen. Out of that less than 1 kitchen, fewer than 20 percent are branded and 80 percent are non-branded. So, a minuscule 0.2 percent of the total available addressable market is organised kitchen, which means the whole field is open. In many cities, we are the only organised player there.</p>\n<p>\n\tAll the players are going to grow at least 30 percent to 40 percent just because the size of the market is so big and the organised sector has penetrated little. The biggest growth drivers are going to be the organisations and Tier 2 Tier 3 cities like Indore, Lucknow, Chandigarh, Jaipur, coming at par with the metro cities. And, I see that process happening very quickly.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Has inflation made your product range costlier?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWe took one price rise of 5 to 10 percent in January but after that, March-April onwards, prices of a lot of commodities have sort of stopped increasing, resulting in a lot of normalisation. So, we have not taken a price hike after January. Freight costs have gone up. But gross margins are not suffering. We are not looking at any further price rise because we also want to remain competitive at this phase of our growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/finance_pic/2022/d0fd48bc6de92684246669c1228776b82.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Who are your competitors?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSleek backed by Asian Paints and Godrej. Those are the two biggest competitors because they are in the same space as us. Home solutions like Livspace, and Homelane have started coming in but for them, the kitchen is a very small part and the rest of the whole house is the bigger business for them. And, there are many localised and regional players who are very solid. Kutchina in the east is big. Makwana is also there.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Tell us about the launch of your latest and upgraded products.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tCurrently, what we see in the modular kitchen segment is that in the name of innovation people are just copying and pasting designs trending in Italy and Germany. But we feel that Indian cooking and the way it&#39;s done is very different. Our climate is very different which changes the choice of material entirely.</p>\n<p>\n\tFunctionality tops our design focus which we do by interacting with the end customer. By end customer, I don&#39;t necessarily mean the person who pays for the kitchen but the person who is the boss of the kitchen. They know the requirements like functionality, storage, and accessibility among other things.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo achieve this, we are launching a new tech platform to interact with customers. It is a complete KYC to know the smallest details about your kitchen needs.&nbsp; Ours is not one size fits all. Once the customers tell their requirements, they can immediately see the options available for one lakh rupees to five lakh rupees.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Are your kitchen fit for old houses also?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t30% of our business is renovation. 70% is new homes. It changes seasonally but that is the usual business we do.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How are your various product categories doing in the Eastern region?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIt is my biggest region so I feel it is always doing well in terms of the modular kitchen market. Our product categories include modular kitchens, Wardrobes, TV units, and bar units and now we have added kitchen appliances after coming together with Prestige. Other than that, nothing. We only want to look at the kitchen. We want to be space experts.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/finance_pic/2022/d0fd48bc6de92684246669c1228776b83.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>What is your market share in the country among organised players?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIt may be around 5 percent. It&#39;s a ballpark number as we cannot assess how big the business of our competitors is in the modular kitchen segment.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How do you see the inflation impacting modular kitchen business, which is your biggest segment?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAs the real estate sector has done very well in the last 12 months, we are sure our market will also expand. Due to inflation, buyers&rsquo; disposable income may have gone down, causing a reduction in the ticket size but the number of customers to acquire remains the same.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Tier 2 cities, there is still a lot of disposable income available. Given the performance of the real estate market, I don&#39;t think there will be a big effect on us right now. The lag effect might come one or two years down the line.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>How are you going to use the proceeds of the merger with Prestige?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIt will be a mix of capex and opex but majorly capex. We have expanded factory capacity, and added some warehousing to improve distribution. We are investing heavily in the tech that I spoke about. So, all of this is under capex. Not much of opex is required because this is a cash flow-positive business. The rest of it will go to brand-building efforts. Largely, we are looking at capacity building and technology.</p>"

To do so, we are proactively deepening economic integration with trusted trading partners like India.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>&quot; Our strategy will also create redundancies in our supply chain to mitigate over-concentration risks.

We seek integration with the large group of countries that we can count on &ndash; developing countries and advanced economies alike. In fact, part of our &#39;friendshoring&#39; approach involves partnering with developing countries to grow local industries and connect them to the global supply chain.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>&quot;For example, our development finance institution is providing America&rsquo;s largest solar manufacturer with up to $500 million in debt financing to build a facility in Tamil Nadu in India. This facility will boost India&rsquo;s solar manufacturing capacity. At the same time, it will help diversify supply chains away from China, which currently dominates over 80 percent of global solar panel production. Our investments are also consistent with our values: certain solar panel materials produced in China &ndash; like those from the Xinjiang region &ndash; are known to be produced with forced labor,&quot; she said.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tShe said signs could be seen where Western firms are diversifying their supply chains beyond China.</p>\n<div>\n\t<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n\t\t\tJoint Press Briefing of the meeting of the India-US Economic Financial Partnership by FM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nsitharaman?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@nsitharaman</a> and US Treasury Secretary <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecYellen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@SecYellen</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FinMinIndia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@FinMinIndia</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/BZxNpAFQDA\">pic.twitter.com/BZxNpAFQDA</a></p>\n\t\t&mdash; DD News (@DDNewslive) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DDNewslive/status/1590994673291923463?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 11, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\t<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n\t</script>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t&quot;Technology companies like Amazon and Google are investing in India and Vietnam.

You have to engage them in three seconds or they will never engage with the product,&rdquo; Kakkar said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking on &ldquo;Media, its Evolution and Role in Current Society,&quot; Prahlad Kakkar said, &quot;We have to learn to keep moving forward with today&rsquo;s generation. We cannot lie to them. They are not satisfied by one news source. They tend to cross check across various platforms.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;People want to hear unbiased news. They should have a backbone and shouldn&rsquo;t sell themselves. They should build credibility for the younger people and be relevant,&quot; said the advertising filmmaker.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe ICC conclave was a net-working forum for the business community which gained insights into both the roles of media as well as current marketing strategies.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe speakers were Vandana Ramakrishna, COO, Madison Media Ace; Anindya Ghosh, Founding Partner, Sam &amp; Andy; Michel Boutin, Director Design and Sales, Australian Fashion Group and Prahlad Kakkar, Indian Ad Guru and Director, Genesis Films.</p>\n<p>\n\tNamit Bajoria, Chairman ICC National Expert Committee on Retail and Marketing, stated, &ldquo;We have witnessed the three eras of consumer behavior and marketing in the span of the last 3 years&ndash;Pre Pandemic, Pandemic and Post Pandemic. The purpose of this event is to understand the new marketing ways and role of media in the current scenario for the growth of brands.&rdquo;</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Prahlad Kakkar said, &ldquo;A success story stands on its failures. Failing is not a bad thing. It teaches you humility and the value of success. Stigmatizing failure will cast one to the role of a job seeker.&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tMichel Boutin on valuation of a brand said, &ldquo;Brand is a concept. It&rsquo;s not a service. Disruption is the challenge to the status quo. For me, valuation of a brand is based on the service provided, projection of being successful on a promise of something.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tAnindya Ghosh said, &ldquo;Evolution is part of the business. Understanding the consumer will help us to deal with the evolving consumer. We must be loyal to our customers and be honest.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tVandana Ramakrishna said, &ldquo;We should adapt to the growing new consumer base and digitize the brand as the younger generation are all digitized.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe panel discussion was moderated by veteran public relations personality Rita Bhimani.</p>\n<p>\n\tRepresentatives of over 30 international brands/companies which were present used this opportunity to interact with other members of the business community, to gain not only insights but also sharing their business strategies, plans and contacts with each other.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(Reporting by Ayush Gupta)</strong></p>"

Thus, no transition away from coal is happening in foreseeable future in India, the minister maintained.</p>\n<p>\n\tDuring the meeting, a presentation was made by Joint Secretary to the Ministry of Coal BP Pati gave a presentation highlighting that although there are no immediate challenges of coal phase-down, the coal companies will have to manage the closure of already abandoned mines and coal mines that will close normally in near future - in a manner aligned to Just Transition principles.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe existing Mine closure guidelines are still evolving.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese guidelines primarily focus on physical and environmental aspects of mine closure and do not address properly social aspects of mine closure and repurposing of land and infrastructure assets.</p>\n<p>\n\tHence, there is a need for developing a uniform comprehensive sustainable mine closure framework on Just Transition principles along with the development of an appropriate institutional arrangement and funding mechanism covering every aspect of mine closure.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe members of the committee said that the framework will also facilitate capacity building for managing coal mine closures that may happen in long term due to change in India&rsquo;s energy mix.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey suggested that public representatives should be consulted more frequently by coal companies on the issues like environment protection, coal mine closures, social welfare and productivity.</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tTaking accountability for the decision taken to lay off 11,000 employees, CEO Mark Zuckerberg, said in a statement: &quot; Today I&rsquo;m sharing some of the most difficult changes we&rsquo;ve made in Meta&rsquo;s history. I&rsquo;ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1,&quot; he siad.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>He said: &quot;At the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth.

I&rsquo;ve decided to reduce the size of our team by about 13% and let more than 11,000 of our talented employees go. We are also taking a number of additional steps to become a leaner and more efficient company by cutting discretionary spending and extending our hiring freeze through Q1.</p>\n<p>\n\tI want to take accountability for these decisions and for how we got here. I know this is tough for everyone, and I&rsquo;m especially sorry to those impacted.</p>\n<p>\n\tHow did we get here?</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the start of Covid, the world rapidly moved online and the surge of e-commerce led to outsized revenue growth. Many people predicted this would be a permanent acceleration that would continue even after the pandemic ended. I did too, so I made the decision to significantly increase our investments. Unfortunately, this did not play out the way I expected. Not only has online commerce returned to prior trends, but the macroeconomic downturn, increased competition, and ads signal loss have caused our revenue to be much lower than I&rsquo;d expected. I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn this new environment, we need to become more capital efficient. We&rsquo;ve shifted more of our resources onto a smaller number of high priority growth areas &mdash; like our AI discovery engine, our ads and business platforms, and our long-term vision for the metaverse. We&rsquo;ve cut costs across our business, including scaling back budgets, reducing perks, and shrinking our real estate footprint. We&rsquo;re restructuring teams to increase our efficiency. But these measures alone won&rsquo;t bring our expenses in line with our revenue growth, so I&rsquo;ve also made the hard decision to let people go.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><span style=\"color:#b22222;\"><strong>How will this work?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no good way to do a layoff, but we hope to get all the relevant information to you as quickly as possible and then do whatever we can to support you through this.</p>\n<p>\n\tEveryone will get an email soon letting you know what this layoff means for you. After that, every affected employee will have the opportunity to speak with someone to get their questions answered and join information sessions.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#b22222;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Some of the details in the US include:</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tSeverance. We will pay 16 weeks of base pay plus two additional weeks for every year of service, with no cap.</p>\n<p>\n\tPTO. We&rsquo;ll pay for all remaining PTO time.</p>\n<p>\n\tRSU vesting. Everyone impacted will receive their November 15, 2022 vesting.</p>\n<p>\n\tHealth insurance. We&rsquo;ll cover the cost of healthcare for people and their families for six months.</p>\n<p>\n\tCareer services. We&rsquo;ll provide three months of career support with an external vendor, including early access to unpublished job leads.</p>\n<p>\n\tImmigration support. I know this is especially difficult if you&rsquo;re here on a visa. There&rsquo;s a notice period before termination and some visa grace periods, which means everyone will have time to make plans and work through their immigration status. We have dedicated immigration specialists to help guide you based on what you and your family need.</p>\n<p>\n\tOutside the US, support will be similar, and we&rsquo;ll follow up soon with separate processes that take into account local employment laws.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe made the decision to remove access to most Meta systems for people leaving today given the amount of access to sensitive information. But we&rsquo;re keeping email addresses active throughout the day so everyone can say farewell.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile we&rsquo;re making reductions in every organization across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs, some teams will be affected more than others. Recruiting will be disproportionately affected since we&rsquo;re planning to hire fewer people next year. We&rsquo;re also restructuring our business teams more substantially. This is not a reflection of the great work these groups have done, but what we need going forward. The leaders of each group will schedule time to discuss what this means for your team over the next couple of days.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe teammates who will be leaving us are talented and passionate, and have made an important impact on our company and community. Each of you have helped make Meta a success, and I&rsquo;m grateful for it. I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ll go on to do great work at other places.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhat other changes are we making?</p>\n<p>\n\tI view layoffs as a last resort, so we decided to rein in other sources of cost before letting teammates go. Overall, this will add up to a meaningful cultural shift in how we operate. For example, as we shrink our real estate footprint, we&rsquo;re transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office. We&rsquo;ll roll out more cost-cutting changes like this in the coming months.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe&rsquo;re also extending our hiring freeze through Q1 with a small number of exceptions. I&rsquo;m going to watch our business performance, operational efficiency, and other macroeconomic factors to determine whether and how much we should resume hiring at that point. This will give us the ability to control our cost structure in the event of a continued economic downturn. It will also put us on a path to achieve a more efficient cost structure than we outlined to investors recently.</p>\n<p>\n\tI&rsquo;m currently in the middle of a thorough review of our infrastructure spending. As we build our AI infrastructure, we&rsquo;re focused on becoming even more efficient with our capacity. Our infrastructure will continue to be an important advantage for Meta, and I believe we can achieve this while spending less.</p>\n<p>\n\tFundamentally, we&rsquo;re making all these changes for two reasons: our revenue outlook is lower than we expected at the beginning of this year, and we want to make sure we&rsquo;re operating efficiently across both Family of Apps and Reality Labs.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#b22222;\"><span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>How do we move forward?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tThis is a sad moment, and there&rsquo;s no way around that. To those who are leaving, I want to thank you again for everything you&rsquo;ve put into this place. We would not be where we are today without your hard work, and I&rsquo;m grateful for your contributions.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo those who are staying, I know this is a difficult time for you too. Not only are we saying goodbye to people we&rsquo;ve worked closely with, but many of you also feel uncertainty about the future. I want you to know that we&rsquo;re making these decisions to make sure our future is strong.</p>\n<p>\n\tI believe we are deeply underestimated as a company today. Billions of people use our services to connect, and our communities keep growing. Our core business is among the most profitable ever built with huge potential ahead. And we&rsquo;re leading in developing the technology to define the future of social connection and the next computing platform. We do historically important work. I&rsquo;m confident that if we work efficiently, we&rsquo;ll come out of this downturn stronger and more resilient than ever.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe&rsquo;ll share more on how we&rsquo;ll operate as a streamlined organization to achieve our priorities in the weeks ahead. For now, I&rsquo;ll say one more time how thankful I am to those of you who are leaving for everything you&rsquo;ve done to advance our mission.</p>\n<p>\n\tMark&quot;</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tInvestors, wary of the impact of supply bottlenecks induced by Covid and the relentless rise in raw material prices in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have lately focused on a section of consumption stocks. This has been quite evident in the current quarter, which marked the arrival of the ongoing festive season.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>While input costs are still at very high levels, select pockets of the consumption sector have already recorded a marked escalation in revenues. The sector as a whole, as some quarters believe, is readying for firmer trends to emerge.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tSome quarters are said to be specifically looking for value-buying in medium-sized consumption stocks. This, according to stock brokers, indicates bargain hunting by investors who are clearly seeking fresh opportunities, at least in the medium term.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThese sections are believed to have been spurred by recent developments in the consumption space. Indeed, select segments have already witnessed a series of product consolidations and price corrections. The presence of dynamic brands, a number of which have fortified their positions, will spur growth in the days ahead, it is felt. New and emerging consumption businesses will particularly reflect the change.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/finance_pic/2022/b9eaeed5d14cba3f83ae42e2bb8f160a1.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe market, broking analysts maintain, will witness the arrival of newer brands in the food and edibles space. An review of various reports reveal positive developments in at least three distinct spaces:</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\n\t●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milk-based products and sundry confectionary items</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\n\t●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fruit-based flavoured drinks (non-alcoholic beverages)</p>\n<p style=\"margin-left:36pt;\">\n\t●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Products based on soya and soya-extracts</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the non-food segment, brokers have identified newer possibilities in areas like cosmetics, paints, bathroom hygiene products and home decoratives. At another level, consumer services businesses are also likely to gather steam in the days ahead, it is felt. Many of these will be digitally enabled. All of these will be driven by robust consumption patterns. The latter will be seen in both rural and urban markets.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite all the ebullience, dissenting voices are being heard too. These essentially stem from fears expressed in the wake of geopolitical conflicts, leading to even higher inflation. Dissidents in particular underscore the latest stands adopted by banking regulators around the world. The spectre of inflation, which has spurred hawkish regulatory strategies, may well spook consumption trends in future, at least in the short term.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Consumption businesses will pass on the impact of higher input costs to their customers. This already happened to a marked extent &ndash; and prices of many commonly available consumables have grossly increased. The largest players in the domain, including Hindustan Unilever, Nestle, ITC, Tata Consumer, Britannia, Godrej and Marico, have corrected their product pricing styles.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tInflation around the world will impact discretionary spending everywhere, it is felt. In a country like India, the trend will be particularly evident. Already for consumption businesses across the board, the prices of vegetable oil, wheat and other key ingredients have escalated. This has threatened to depress gross margins.</p>\n<p>\n\tOnly the patient investor who seeks value, therefore, will appreciate the quirky scenario. Beyond the more established players (especially those engaged in food and beverages) are a host of smaller enterprises. Some of these are engaged in electronics, watches, apparel and footwear The market anticipates a round of value-buying in such segments.</p>\n<p>\n\t(Nilanjan Dey is Director, Wishlist Capital and author of&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0B8SXTDC4/ref%3Dcm_sw_r_apa_i_ZMEGVPFF7ZX3EPJKT35K_0&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1667885831499000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0Bbn5m2On9tmpSzsDYd3mE\" href=\"https://www.amazon.in/dp/B0B8SXTDC4/ref=cm_sw_r_apa_i_ZMEGVPFF7ZX3EPJKT35K_0\" target=\"_blank\"><em>No Room For Less</em></a>.

The Bank doesn&rsquo;t want to slow the economy too much with its interventions.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tHigher interest rates will mean higher repayments on things like mortgages, credit cards and car loans - increasing the financial pressure on lots of households.</p>\n<p>\n\tA hike in interest rates will drive more workers into debt and other forms of financial hardship, a major trade union has warned, the BBC report said.</p>\n<p>\n\tA survey of 6,000 people on behalf of Unite has revealed that more than half cannot or will have difficulty paying their bills this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe union&#39;s general secretary Sharon Graham says their research shows many workers &quot;face unsurmountable financial pressure&quot;.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe poll also suggests more than two thirds of workers have experienced a real-terms pay cut this year (when their wages are rising at below the rate of prices).</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Graham went on to argue that the problem which is driving inflation is not worker&#39;s wage demands, but rather &quot;corporate greed&quot;, the BBC added.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tRenters could find it more difficult to find properties in the next year or two as landlords struggle with higher mortgage rates, an expert told MPs on Wednesday.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>About 40 percent of landlords have a mortgage on their rental properties.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe BBC report quoted Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, as saying that the Bank of England is &quot;likely to be divided&quot;, with some policymakers on its Monetary Policy Committee pushing for a smaller increase in the base rate of 0.5 percentage points.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;The size of the increase will signal how concerned Bank of England policymakers are about inflation versus a recession as it looks to curtail further price rises without inadvertently causing unnecessary economic pain,&quot; she said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tShe pointed out that the mortgage market has calmed down since former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng&#39;s mini-budget and the U-turns that followed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>But she also added that about two million borrowers on variable rate mortgages look set to face increased payments after Thursday&#39;s decision.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe war in Ukraine and the long recovery from the pandemic have also contributed to rising energy and food costs.</p>"

Senior MPs and peers had called for the account to be removed until TikTok gave &quot;credible assurances&quot; that no data could be handed to Beijing, the BBC reported.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe app has also been investigated by The Irish Data Protection Commission - its lead regulator in the EU - over two privacy-related issues.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The watchdog is looking into TikTok&#39;s processing of children&#39;s personal data, and whether it has acted in line with EU laws over transferring personal data to other countries, such as China.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tIn 2020, a US national security panel ordered ByteDance to sell its American operation over concerns that users&#39; data could be shared with Chinese authorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn June this year TikTok said it had migrated US users&#39; information to servers run by American software giant Oracle in Austin, Texas</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t.<strong>Last month, TikTok denied a report that a China-based team at ByteDance planned to use the app to track the locations of US citizens.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tTikTok said it had never been used to &quot;target&quot; the American government, activists, public figures or journalists.<br />\n\tOn Wednesday, Fox also said the app does not collect precise location data from users in Europe.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to analytics company Sensor Tower, TikTok has made more than $6.2billion in gross revenue from in-app spending since its launch in 2017.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

However, sequentially quarter-over-quarter, edible oil grew by 17% in volumes, suggesting an uptick in demand in Q2FY23.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Company witnessed multiple headwinds on the margin front, with the high volatility in edible oil prices, allotment of lower TRQ (Tariff Rate Quota) and inflation impact on our operating expenses.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Company grew YoY by 9% in volumes and 4% in revenue in Q2FY23.</p>\n<p>\n\tA significant contribution came from Food &amp; FMCG as well as Industry Essentials, which grew robustly at 41% and 22% y-o-y, respectively &ndash; thereby driving larger diversification in the revenue base and strengthening the platform for multiple business growth drivers for the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Relaunch of Kohinoor and other brands in the Rice segment:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tPost the acquisition of Kohinoor brand in May 2022, the company relaunched the entire product range to the markets in August 2022.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe company is optimistic on the prospects of market share gains in the rice business with the strategy of addressing the premium consumer segment through Kohinoor brand and mass segment through brand Charminar, and penetrating the HoReCa segment through the Trophy brand.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Market Share: (Nielsen MAT September 2022)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMarket share in Edible Oil grew by 30 basis points to 18.5% on a standalone basis and 19.5% on a consolidated basis.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Fortune Atta</strong> continued to gain market share reaching 4.9% share as against 3.9% in the same quarter last year;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Fortune Basmati</strong> and Kohinoor now has a combined market share of 10%, with Fortune share growing from 5.1% to 8.5%.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith the recent relaunch of Kohinoor brand in the market, company expects further gains in market share.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Profitability:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe quarter witnessed multiple headwinds in the edible oil segment.</p>\n<p>\n\tDue to macro factors affecting the demand-supply situation in edible oils, there was a steep decline in prices of palm oil, soyabean oil and sunflower during the quarter.<br />\n\tSharp fall in prices left most of the players with high price inventory in hand.<br />\n\tThe company also passed on the benefit of lower prices to the consumers.<br />\n\tThis coupled with currency depreciation impacted margins during the quarter.<br />\n\tHowever, this is purely cyclical in nature and on account of events that the industry witnessed in the quarter.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe tariff rate quota (TRQ) announced by the government in July 2022 was a step towards controlling inflation.<br />\n\tWhile this was a welcome move for the industry and consumers, it put the company into a disadvantageous position, given that the quota share allocated to us was lower than both our market share and manufacturing capacity.<br />\n\tAs a result, cost of sourcing of soyabean oil for us was higher than the competition leading to a disparity in the business.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe inflation impact on operating cost added further pressure on margins in Q2FY23.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Near-term Outlook:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSeptember 2022 witnessed higher edible oil imports of 1.59 MMT against 1.37 MMT in August 2022, the company said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;We see positive signs of recovery going forward in edible oils business for H2FY23, with softening of commodity prices and the recent uptick in demand on the back of festivities and weddings, it added.</p>"

The order will come into effect immediately.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn view of the restoration of ample supplies and the continuous decline in the prices of edible oils both in the international as well as the domestic market, it was an opportune time for the exemption of wholesalers and Bulk consumers (big chain retailers shops) from the stock limit control order.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe removal will also have a positive effect on the oilseed prices as it will boost procurement of the oilseeds hereby increasing the returns of domestic oilseeds-growing farmers, it added.</p>"

The possibilities of using weaponized drones for terrorist purposes against strategic, infrastructure and commercial assets call for serious attention by the member states, he added.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDr Jaishankar said Indias own experience of the 2008 Mumbai attacks showed that how a benign technology of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) could be used for organizing and directing such a barbaric terrorist attack from beyond the borders.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore recently, these terrorist groups have been using unmanned aerial platforms, such as drones and quadcopters for cross border trafficking of drugs and arms and for carrying out terrorist attacks, he said.</p>"

He also mentioned the Vedic scholar Rajeshwar Shastri who lived in Kashi even though he had his roots in Tamil Nadu.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said that the people of Kashi also miss Pattaviram Shastri who lived on Hanuman Ghat in Kashi. The Prime Minister informed about the Kashi Kaam Koteshwar Panchayatan Mandir which is a Tamilian temple on the banks of Harishchandra Ghat, and the two-hundred-year-old Kumarswamy Matt and Markande Ashram on Kedar Ghat.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also stated that many people from Tamil Nadu have been living near the banks of Kedar Ghat and Hanuman Ghat, and have made immense contributions towards Kashi for several generations.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister also mentioned the great poet and revolutionary, Shri Subramania Bharathi who hailed from Tamil Nadu but lived in Kashi for many years.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe informed about BHU&rsquo;s pride and privilege in establishing the chair dedicated to Subramania Bharati.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister underlined that the Kashi-Tamil Sangam is taking place during the Azadi Ka Amrit Kaal.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said, &ldquo;In Amrit Kaal, our resolutions will be fulfilled by the unity of the whole country.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tHe stated that India is a nation which has lived a natural cultural unity for thousands of years. Throwing light on the tradition of remembering 12 Jyotirlingas after waking up in the morning, the Prime Minister said that we start our day by remembering the spiritual unity of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tModi also lamented the lack of efforts to strengthen this tradition and heritage of thousands of years.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe further added that Kashi-Tamil Sangamam will become a platform for this resolution today while making us realise our duties, and being a source of energy to strengthen national unity.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister said that it was through this attitude of breaking language and surpassing the intellectual distance that Swami Kumargurupar came to Kashi and made it his Karmbhoomi and got Kedareshwar Mandir constructed in Kashi.</p>\n<p>\n\tLater, his disciples got Kashi Vishwanath temple constructed in Thanjavur on the banks of river Kaveri. The Prime Minister reiterated the link between Tamil scholars and Kashi by mentioning personalities like Manonmaniyam Sundaranar who wrote a Tamil State song and the connection of his guru with Kashi.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister also remembered the role of Ramayana and Mahabharata written by Raja ji in connecting the North and the South.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This is my experience that without understanding scholars from South India like Ramanujacharya, Shankaracharya, Raja Ji to Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan, we simply can not understand Indian philosophy,&rdquo; Modi said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister said that the Sangamam is a matter of experiencing more than the words and expressed the hope that people of Kashi will leave no stone unturned in providing memorable hospitality.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister expressed the wish that such events are organised in Tamil Nadu and other Southern states and youngsters from other parts of the county visit and absorb the culture there.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe gains of this sangamam need to be taken forward through research and this seed should become a giant tree, the Prime Minister concluded.</p>"

China&rsquo;s exports to its largest trading partner, the U.S, fell by 12.6% in October, a third-straight month of decline. Exports to the EU were down by 9%.</p>\n<p>\n\tHigh inflationary pressure forced the US and Europe to squeeze the money supply in their respective economies.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>The U.S. Federal Reserve is resorting to aggressive interest rate hikes ignoring the risks of triggering recessionary trends. As the demand slows down in the West, the pressure is felt in China.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tIn a recent forecast, Barclays predicted that China&rsquo;s exports will drop by 2% to 5% in 2023 due to the global recession. The British banking major had cut the 2023 GDP forecast for China from 4.5% to 3.8% in September, owing to the sustained decline of the property sector.</p>\n<p>\n\tProperty contributes nearly one-third of China&rsquo;s GDP. A Reuters poll forecasted China&#39;s growth to slow to 3.2% in 2022, far below the official target of around 5.5%, marking one of the worst performances in four decades.</p>\n<p>\n\tClearly, the Chinese economy is in the doldrums and that is admitted by none other than the outgoing Vice-Premier Liu He, who was instrumental in shaping Beijing&rsquo;s economic policies over the past decade. And, that takes us to the second and more important development.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>To be fair, it doesn&rsquo;t require any expert to confirm that the famous Chinese growth story is facing a serious headwind. Xi&rsquo;s &lsquo;Zero Covid&rsquo; restrictions (right now the manufacturing hub of Guangzhou is under lockdown) might have added to the pressure but it&#39;s not the sole cause.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tA cursory look at the graph above will tell that leaving the covid years of 2020 and 2021, China&rsquo;s quarterly GDP growth has been witnessing a consistent decline since the global financial meltdown in 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\tNotably, this is also the period of Xi&rsquo;s rise to power (2012), Beijing&rsquo;s belligerent show of strength on both economic and military fronts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThere were a series of territorial disputes with neighbours. From Vietnam and the Philippines in the South China sea to Japan in the East China sea and even Indonesia in the Indian Ocean, everyone accused China of trespassing into their territories and brazen attempts to grab land.&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>On the southern border, a tiny Nepal meekly surrendered to Chinese land grab attempts but, India resisted at least two attempts by the People&rsquo;s Liberation Army (PLA) at Dokalam (2018) and Galwan Valley (2020). The second one took place during the pandemic.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tEconomically, Beijing nearly declared itself a superpower during the period. Outlandish attempts were made to buy out foreign governments, mostly small or disturbed states, and influence their policy-making, through the Belt and Road Initiative.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThough packaged as an economic integration initiative, BRI is an expansionist political move backed by the fat moneybag created out of decades of patronage of the West, particularly the US.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<img alt=\"\" src=\"/userfiles/images/1(481).jpg\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 537px;\" /></p>\n<p>\n\tThe interlinking of the two economies helped Beijing to influence American policies till the beginning of the last decade when the US finally realized that China was taking advantage of the WTO regime to unfairly corner global trade and manufacturing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Allegations were rife against China from the early 2000s that it uses its opaque financial, banking and legal system, to pass state subsidies to targeted sectors in violation of the WTO guidelines. Goods were dumped in the marketplace to outprice competitive economies and kill their domestic manufacturing. Between 1978 (when China opened) to 2010, the US lost almost its entire automobile manufacturing industry to China.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tIndia might be the pharmacy of the world but the global Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) &ndash; the prime raw material &ndash; manufacturing shifted to China. It was a peculiar situation. China held the keys to everyone&rsquo;s growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe pitfalls were visible during the pandemic (and are still visible). The arbitrary lockdowns in China were a prime reason behind the global supply chain disruption and inflation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe rumblings against China&rsquo;s trade practices were audible for quite some time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>The Donald Trump administration in the US acted against it by hiking tariff barriers for Chinese goods. China went for retaliatory measures. Beijing thought that it had garnered enough political and economic muscle to defy the world order. But that didn&rsquo;t happen.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFirst, India upped the ante against China after the Galwan clash. Beijing almost lost the huge telecom market in that country. Australia too took a strong exception after facing the wrath of the Chinese during the pandemic. Poor countries, indebted to China, became poorer during the pandemic. Some went burst. Social unrest forced them to take a relook at the BRI terms thereby blocking China&rsquo;s easy export (including export of labour) options.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, the supply chain disruption and unrelenting muscle flexing by Beijing forced all major economies to reconsider their China strategy. Major consuming economies were keen to diversify the sourcing destinations.</p>\n<p>\n\tSouth Korea and Japan which were major investors in China were keen to relocate. Taiwan wanted to de-risk itself from rising threats from China by shifting part of the production bases to safer destinations. India is gaining significantly from these trends. From Samsung of South Korea to Foxconn (supplier to Apple) of Taiwan all are investing in India as their global production base.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>The results are visible in India&rsquo;s export performance. While global trade remains depressed and is expected to rise by a mere 1% this year, India&rsquo;s total exports in April-September 2022 period is up by 21% to $382 billion. Goods exports are up by 17% and services by 28%. The Indian government is confident that goods export to increase by 10-12% this year.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tUnlike China&rsquo;s declining growth, India maintained steady growth over the last decade. A look at the quarterly GDP growth data will tell, India is now firing from all cylinders. Notably, domestic demand is playing a crucial role in pushing India&rsquo;s growth numbers.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe chain of events forced Chinese Vice-Premier Liu He to take a relook at China&rsquo;s growth strategies. As the export-led growth model is facing increasing vulnerability, domestic demand could have rescued the Chinese economy. Beijing tried to push domestic demand but the effort didn&rsquo;t yield desired results as yet. As in 2022, massive spending on infrastructure &ndash; up 8.6 per cent, year on year, in the first nine months &ndash; failed to turn around the lacklustre industrial growth scenario.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>It means, there is no escape from export-led growth either in the immediate run. That&#39;s possible if China gives up its belligerence and adheres to global norms. That&rsquo;s exactly the prescription of Liu He. &ldquo;The vice-premier insisted that China must adhere to a high level of opening, deeply participate in the global industrial division, and &ldquo;interact actively&rdquo; with the outside world,&rdquo; SCMP reported.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tObviously, the sermon was given in conformity with the party line. But the message was clear: China is getting isolated and that&rsquo;s risky. &ldquo;We should aim for international high-standard economic and trade rules, and creates a market-oriented, law-based and international business environment,&rdquo; Liu was quoted saying by the newspaper.</p>",

        "content": "<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;There must be a cost imposed upon countries that support terrorism. Organisations and individuals that try to create sympathy for terrorists must also be isolated.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;There can be no ifs and buts entertained in such matters. The world needs to unite against all kinds of overt and covert backing of terror,&quot; he said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&quot;It is well known that terrorist organizations get money through several sources. One source is state support. Certain countries support terrorism as part of their foreign policy.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;They offer political, ideological and financial support to them,&quot; the Prime Minister said, adding that international organisations must not think that the absence of war means peace.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a veiled attack on China as well for repeatedly blocking India&#39;s bids to blacklist Pakistan based dreaded terrorists at the UN, the Prime Minister said that there is no place for ambiguous approach on the issue.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;Sometimes, there are indirect arguments made in support of terrorism to block action against terrorists. There is no place for an ambiguous approach while dealing with a global threat,&quot; he stressed.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tModi said that terrorism is an attack on humanity, freedom and civilisation.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt knows no boundaries, only a uniform, unified and zero-tolerance approach can defeat terrorism, he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister also pointed out that ideally there should be no need for anyone to remind the world of the dangers of terrorism, however, he said, &quot;There are still certain mistaken notions about terrorism in some circles.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;The intensity of the reaction to different attacks cannot vary based on where it happens. All terrorist attacks deserve equal outrage and action.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister emphasised that uprooting terrorism needs a larger proactive response as tactical gains against terrorists may be lost in absence of a larger strategy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;Fighting a terrorist and fighting terrorism are two different things. A terrorist may be neutralised with weapons. Immediate tactical responses to terrorists may be an operational matter. But tactical gains will soon be lost without a larger strategy aimed at hurting their finances,&quot; he said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;If we want our citizens to be safe, then we cannot wait until terror comes to our homes. We must pursue terrorists, break their support networks and hit their finances,&quot; the Prime Minister added.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister also stressed on the need to take concerted action against major criminal networks as they have deep links with terror outfits.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;One of the sources of terror funding is organised crime. Organised crime should not be seen in isolation. These gangs often have deep links with terrorist outfits,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe money made in gun-running, drugs and smuggling is pumped into terrorism, the Prime Minister added.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said that the criminal syndicates help with logistics and communication to terrorists, therefore, action against organised crime is extremely important in the fight against terror.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;At times, even activities like money laundering and financial crimes have been known to help terror funding. Fighting it needs global collaboration,&quot; the Prime Minister added.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister said that there is a need for a uniform understanding of new finance technologies as &quot;new kinds of technology are being used for terror financing and recruitment.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister also spoke in favour of involving the private sector in such efforts.</p>\n<p>\n\tModi began the address by saying that India faced the horrors of terror long before the world took serious note of it. He said that the country has lost thousands of precious lives, but it has fought terrorism bravely.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;The delegates have a chance to interact with a country and people who have been firm in tackling terror. We consider that even a single attack is one too many. Even a single life lost is one too many. So, we will not rest till terrorism is uprooted,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tIndia is hosting the two day &#39;No Money For Terror&#39; Ministerial Conference on Counter-Terrorism Financing with participation of over 75 countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is being attended by about 450 delegates from across the world, including Ministers, Heads of Multilateral organisations and Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Heads of Delegations.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Conference offers a unique platform for participating nations and organizations to deliberate on effectiveness of the current international regime on Counter Terrorism Financing as well as steps required to address emerging challenges.</p>",

The copy of the letter was provided to all media persons at the end of the press conference which the Chief Minister held at his residence before departing for ED office for questioning.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;It does not befit the ED to make sensational statements of illegal mining of Rs 1000 crore without ascertaining the facts and figures and that too after carrying out some 50 raids in an investigation going on for almost a year.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;I hope and trust that you will reconsider your claims and refrain from making sensational statement which are unsubstantiated by any facts or figures as such reckless statements not only tarnish the reputation of concerned state departments and personnel but the image of the state of Jharkhand suffers,&quot; one of the paragraphs of the letter reads.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Chief Minister has written the words before challenging the assessment of the scam amount (Rs 1000 crore) presenting facts and figures related to stone mining across Jharkhand.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also expressed his concern over the wrong review by an agency like the ED.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The letter suggests that the Chief Minister does not see any clear purpose and objectives behind the ED sending him summon to question in case of illegal mining.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&quot;Any state endowed with natural wealth is also afflicted by the curse of illegal mining and Jharkhand is no exception. The undersigned is determined to weed out illegal mining from the state of Jharkhand and welcomes any sincere and honest assistance in this regard from any agency. However, the purpose and objectives of the summons to the undersigned is unclear,&quot; the letter reads.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the letter, the Chief Minister suspected the role of BJP and JMM&rsquo;s former treasurer Ravi Kejriwal behind his summon from the ED office.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;It also appears that the BJP, the main opposition party in the state, has caused a statement to be given by Ravi Kejriwal to falsely implicate me in illegal mining. Ravi Kejirwal was a member of JMM and the treasurer of the party till he was removed in 2020. Subsequently, a FIR was also filed against him by JMM. Since then, Ravi Kejriwal has become my sworn enemy and I would not be surprised if he has made false allegations against me to settle personal scores,&rdquo; the letter said.</p>",

They knew people needed help.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;They knew benefit transfers would help. But they did not have the infrastructure to benefit people. But India showed how technology could be a force for the good,&quot; he said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&quot;Our Jan Dhan Aadhar Mobile Trinity gave us the power to directly transfer benefits. Benefits went directly to authenticated and verified beneficiaries. Billions of rupees reached the bank accounts of the poor,&quot; he stated.</p>\n<p>\n\tModi said his government helped the pandemic-hit small businesses and street vendors by providing them access to working capital to restart businesses.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;Those who start using digital payments are given incentives. This is making digital transactions a way of life for them,&quot; he said.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Modi said India has shown how to democratise technology and give tech a human touch when technology was seen as an exclusive domain which was said to be only for the high and mighty.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tIn India, technology is a force of equality and empowerment, which is mirrored in the world&#39;s largest health insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat that provides a safety net for about 600 million people. &quot;This programme is run based on a tech platform,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tIndia ran the world&#39;s largest Covid-19 vaccine drive through a tech-based platform called Cowin, he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tModi said the central government is successfully running its ecommerce platform called Government e-MarketPlace (GeM) for small businesses and traders, who fulfills the government&#39;s needs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;Technology has helped small businesses find a big customer. At the same time, this has reduced the scope for corruption. Similarly, technology has helped with online tendering.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;This has accelerated projects and boosted transparency. It has also hit a procurement value of Rs 1 trillion last year,&quot; he said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tAlso low data costs helped poor students to attend online classes during the pandemic, without which, two precious years would have been lost for them, Modi said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;India has one of the largest online repositories of open courses. There are thousands of courses available across different subjects. Over 10 million successful certifications have happened. This is all done online and free,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tIndia&#39;s data tariffs are among the lowest in the world, the Prime Minister said.</p>\n<p>\n\tModi said the Indian youth are being empowered by increasing tech access which is reflected in broadband connections rising from 60 million to 810 million and smartphone users from 150 million to 750 million, in the last 8 years.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;The growth of the internet is faster in rural areas than in urban areas. A new demographic is being connected to the information superhighway,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tModi said India&#39;s youth have ensured tech and talent globalisation.&quot;Healthcare, management, finance &ndash; you will find young Indians leading many domains. We are using our talent for global good. Even in India, their impact is being seen,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom ranked 81st in 2015, India has jumped to the 40th rank in the Global Innovation Index this year, Modi said.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;The number of unicorn startups in India has doubled since 2021. We are now the third largest startup hub in the world. We have over 81,000 recognised startups. There are hundreds of international companies that have R&amp;D centres in India. This is due to India&rsquo;s talent pool,&quot; he said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tModi said technology is being used to end silos, enable synergy and ensure service.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;On a shared platform, there are no silos. Take, for example, the PM Gati Shakti National Masterplan. India is investing over Rs 100 trillion in infrastructure over the next few years. The number of stakeholders in any infra project is huge. Traditionally, in India, big projects were often delayed. Exceeding expenses, and extending timelines used to be common,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;But now, we have the Gati Shakti shared platform. The central government, state governments, district administrations, different departments can coordinate. Each of these knows what the other is doing.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;Information relating to projects, land use and institutions are available at a single place. So, each stakeholder sees the same data. This improves coordination and solves problems even before they occur. It is accelerating approvals and clearances,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tModi said India is no more a place known for red tape, but known for red carpet for investors in terms of FDI reforms, liberalization of drone rules, steps in the semiconductor sector, production incentive schemes in various sectors, or the rise of ease of doing business.</p>",

        "description": "<p>\n\tFormer Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was shot and injured during a protest rally in Punjab province on 3 November in an incident that left one bystander dead and at least six others, including leaders of Khan&rsquo;s (PTI), wounded.</p>",
        "imageName": "https://www.indiablooms.com/news_pic/2022//c9800cfe0b00757882cf8afeb8befc56.jpg",
        "publishedAt": "November 15, 2022",
        "content": "<p>\n\tThe attack on Khan has propelled Pakistan into yet another stage of political instability, one fraught with the increased likelihood of further political violence. The reaction to the attack among Imran&rsquo;s supporters has been swift, and protest demonstrations that have been held in all provinces of the country have seen participants assert that the attack had &ldquo;crossed the red line&rdquo; and pledge that they would lay their lives for their leader, whose popularity across the country has surged in recent months.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Pakistan Army, which in the past has swiftly stepped in to rein in potential instability and chaos, today finds itself dealing with political and social polarization of a level not witnessed in the country&rsquo;s history and may, therefore, find its traditional calling as the custodian of law and order in the country difficult to reenact.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnticipating this, the Chief of Army Staff Qamar Javed Bajwa has stressed that the military would remain neutral. Fears, nevertheless, abound that an increase in volatility may well lead to the declaration of martial law, even if initially in only some parts of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe details of how exactly the attack on Imran Khan took place are highly contested. The government said that the lone gunman involved was aggrieved at the un-Islamic practices being indulged in by Khan and his protesting followers, including playing songs and music at rallies even at the time of call for prayers. The former Information Minister in Imran Khan&#39;s cabinet, Fawad Chaudhry, who was behind Khan on the truck, seemed to agree with this version. He told news agency AFP that &ldquo;There was a guy who was in front of the container who had this automatic pistol. He fired a burst. Everyone who was standing in the front row was hit&rdquo;. Imran Khan, on the other hand claimed that there were two attackers. Khan told CNN that &ldquo;They took out three bullets from my right leg. The left had some shrapnel which they&rsquo;ve left inside&rdquo;. He further claimed that the whole assassination plot against him was conceived two months ago, and added, &ldquo;It all started when I was deposed, and from then onwards it was expected that my party would fall apart, but what happened instead was that there was a big public backlash and my party gained immense support&rdquo;. On being asked about what information he has received and by whom, he said that he has got them from within the intelligence agencies. &ldquo;Remember, three and a half years I was in power. I have connections with intelligence agencies, the different agencies that operate&rdquo;. Khan wrote a letter to the country&#39;s President Arif Alvi, asking him to act against the &ldquo;abuse of power and violations of laws and Constitution&rdquo;. He wrote, &ldquo;No person or State institution can be above the law of the land. We have been seeing a massive abuse of citizens at the hands of rogue elements within State organizations, including custodial torture and abductions all carried out with impunity. You hold the highest Office of State and I am requesting you to act now to stop the abuse of power and violations of our laws and of the Constitution, which ensures the fundamental rights of every citizen&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tKhan stepped into risky territory when on 3 November itself he blamed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah, and Director, Counter-Intelligence in the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Major General Faisal Naseer for the attack. Khan called on his supporters to intensify protest against these three officials. &ldquo;As long as these three men don&rsquo;t resign, you have to protest, against unfairness, you must do a jihad against them, jihad means to stand against injustice&rdquo;, he said. Khan also demanded that Pakistan&rsquo;s Army Chief take action against the &ldquo;black sheep&rdquo; within the military and pledged to return to the protest and target Islamabad once he had recovered.</p>\n<p>\n\tKhan&rsquo;s accusations drew an immediate and sharp reaction from the Army, with the Director General (DG) of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the Army&rsquo;s media wing, issuing a statement on 4 November that said, &ldquo;The baseless and irresponsible allegations by Chairman PTI against the institution and particularly a senior officer are absolutely unacceptable and uncalled for. The Pakistan army prides itself for being an extremely professional and well-disciplined organisation&rdquo;. The ISPR also threatened to initiate legal action against Khan. &ldquo;No one will be allowed to defame the institution or its soldiers with impunity. Keeping this in view, the government of Pakistan has been requested to investigate the matter and initiate legal action against those responsible for defamation and false accusations against the institution and its officials without any evidence whatsoever&rdquo;, the ISPR asserted. In Pakistan, it is no ordinary matter to publicly accuse senior intelligence and army officers of conspiring to kill a political leader.</p>\n<p>\n\tPakistan&rsquo;s history over the 75 years of its existence has been characterized by political violence against leaders of all parties and affiliations, beginning with the assassination of its first Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan at a public meeting in Rawalpindi in 1951. Repeated military interventions, both direct and indirect, in politics, particularly at times when the country experienced instability, has been the bane of the country. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a popular Prime Minister, was ousted in a military coup by General Zia-ul Haq and then hanged in April 1979. In 1988, Zia-ul Haq himself died in a plane crash allegedly caused by political enemies. In more recent times Zulfikar Ali Bhutto&rsquo;s daughter and former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was assassinated in December 2007. Prior to that, she had survived a massive suicide bombing in Karachi while campaigning for re-election in 2007. The military leader in charge at the time of Benazir&rsquo;s death &ndash; General Pervez Musharraf &ndash; also faced repeated assassination attempts, with one involving a bomb exploding under a bridge as his car drove over it. Another Prime Minister, Yousaf Raza Gillani, survived an assassination attempt in 2008. In 2011, Shahbaz Bhatti, a Christian who was the Minister for Minority Affairs, was assassinated in Islamabad and Salman Taseer, a liberal businessman who was Governor of the province of Punjab, was shot dead by a bodyguard. Taseer and Bhatti had both been critical of Pakistan&rsquo;s blasphemy laws, which are often used to target religious minorities.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe violence is not directed just at Pakistan&rsquo;s leaders. Other forms of conflict have also influenced Pakistani politics. Over the decades, separatists have battled to win recognition, autonomy and resources from central government with peaceful protest, but also with guns and bombs. Writing in The Guardian, Jason Burke quoted Owen Bennett-Jones, a former BBC Islamabad correspondent and expert on Pakistan as saying, &ldquo;Every day in Pakistan you can open a newspaper and see reports of people who have been killed for political, financial, tribal, or religious motives &hellip; as well as just common criminality, and that goes from top to bottom of society&rdquo;. Bennett-Jones, the author of a book on the Bhutto dynasty, added, &ldquo;One reason for the political violence is that the killers have impunity. Assassins know that they will not go to prison if they have sufficient political backing&rdquo;. Burke underlined that State violence also soared, with the Army and other security forces turning their weapons on citizens in the name of protecting the country from subversion. Armed terrorists and militants were widely used as proxies by the security services to prosecute their own agendas at home and abroad.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs Michael Kugelman pointed out in Foreign Policy, the attack on Khan has put Pakistan&rsquo;s Army in the hot seat as it faces a difficult situation from a weaker position than it is used to, with angry Khan supporters already converging on military facilities in protest. The institution has suffered months of highly unusual direct, public attacks on its leadership. The military, therefore, now lacks some leverage: it has lost popularity, and its current leadership is unsettled as it prepares to bring in a new army chief in the coming weeks. If the PTI in the coming weeks can gather and sustain crowds large enough to meaningfully disrupt life in the capital Islamabad, the Army will find itself further on the backfoot amid intense polarization and anger.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the Stimson Center noted, Imran Khan&rsquo;s popularity has rebounded since his ouster, due in part to unpopular economic decisions his successor has been forced to take. The current long march is the second such protest Khan has held since the spring demanding early elections. In addition to committed PTI supporters, he has also attracted many who are frustrated with Pakistan&rsquo;s current political dispensation &ndash; including the military&rsquo;s role despite its proclaimed neutrality. The ranks of those disaffected swelled further following the October murder of pro-PTI television anchor Arshad Sharif, who was killed by police in Kenya in an alleged case of mistaken identity that has raised questions in Pakistan and prompted unprecedented State denials. Even if instability persists and the military decided to intervene, the reaction of Imran&rsquo;s supporters would be very different from how people reacted to previous military interventions. The assassination attempt on Imran has removed a lot of self-imposed censorship by people. While people demonstrated outside the office of the Corps Commander of Peshawar, others have been recorded chanting that the uniform is behind acts of terrorism and hooliganism.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs the respected Pakistani daily Dawn summarized eloquently in a scathing 7 November editorial titled &lsquo;Democrats, dictators &amp; demagogues&rsquo;, &ldquo;The system is imploding, spectacularly &mdash; collapsing under the weight of the multiple distortions created by decades of political engineering, not to mention outright military takeovers&rdquo;, adding ominously that &ldquo;No one seems to know how it will all end&rdquo;.</p>"

He further instructed the Security Forces (SFs) to intensify anti-Naxalite operations and set up more camps in the area.</p>\n<p>\n\tSignificantly, there has been an increase in rebel activities in the District in the current year.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn August 18, 2022, Communist Party of India-Maoist (CPI-Maoist) cadres killed a man, identified as Ananta Rout (36), a native of Chhattisgarh who had relocated to Dhekunpani more than a decade ago, at Dhekunpani village in the Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary, close to the Chhattisgarh border.&nbsp; The &lsquo;Mainpur-Sunabeda divisional committee&rsquo; of CPI-Maoist claimed responsibility for the incident in through pamphlets and posters, and warned people against working on behalf of the Police.

A total of 12 civilians have been killed in the district since March 6, 2000, when South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), started documenting LWE-linked violence in the country.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, on June 21, 2022, three CRPF personnel were killed in a CPI-Maoist attack in the Patadhara Reserve Forest in the Bheden Block (administrative division). The incident happened when the CRPF personnel were going from one camp to another, and it is suspected that the Maoists had prior information regarding the movement of the forces.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe last fatality in the SF category was reported way back on November 29, 2013, when CPI-Maoist cadres opened fire and killed two Policemen in the Sunabeda Sanctuary area. Seven SF personnel have been killed since March 6, 2000.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn the other hand, the lone Maoist fatality since March 6, 2000, was recorded on April 14, 2014, when a female CPI-Maoist cadre, identified as Jayanti, an armed cadre of the CPI-Maoist &lsquo;Mainpur-Nuapada divisional committee&#39;, was killed in an exchange of fire with SFs in the Sunabeda Sanctuary.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn terms of overall fatalities as well, with four fatalities (data till November 13), 2022 has been the worst year since 2013, which also recorded four fatalities (two civilians and two SF personnel). The district has recorded a high of four fatalities in a year thrice, including 2011. Prior to the June 21, 2022, incident mentioned above, the last killing in the district was reported on April 16, 2018.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe data suggests a spike in Maoist violence in the current year.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther parameters of violence also suggest an increase in Maoist activities. There have been a total of seven Maoist-linked incidents in 2022 (with over a month left) as against three through 2021. There were two and three such incidents in 2019 and 2020, respectively.&nbsp; 2018 recorded 10 incidents. The district has recorded a total of 62 Maoist-linked incidents since March 6, 2000.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the most recent incident, on October 25, 2022, following encounters, SFs neutralized a CPI-Maoist camp and seized arms and ammunition in a forest in Nuapada District. Superintendent of Police, Pratyush Diwakar stated,</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>During the operation, the Maoists opened fire and the security forces retaliated. Following the exchange of fire, the Maoists escaped into deep forest. Later in the day, while the security forces were carrying out combing operation, the Maoists again opened fire and an exchange of fire ensued for around 5 minutes. This time also the Left wing extremists managed to escape. According to our intelligence, a Maoist team led by Murali and Jayaram is moving in the reserve forest on the border with Chhattisgarh. We have intensified the combing operation to nab them.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFollowing the second encounter, the SFs recovered some arms and ammunition.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the official site of the Odisha State Police, LWE activities remained under control in the State, though the problem remained challenging in parts of Nuapada, Koraput, Kalahandi, Rayagada, Kandhamal and Malkangiri Districts.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn June 19, 2021, the Union Ministry of Home Affairs (UMHA) included Nuapada, along with nine other Districts of the State (Bargarh, Bolangir, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Koraput, Nabarangpur, Malkangiri, Rayagada, and Sundargarh), among the 70 LWE-affected Districts in 10 States across India, to be covered under the Centre&#39;s &#39;Security Related Expenditure (SRE)&#39; scheme, which funds focused operations against the ultras.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, on September 7, 2022, in a unique gesture to appeal to all Maoists to shun violence and enter mainstream, and to work together for nation&#39;s progress, the Nuapada Police facilitated the wedding ceremony of two former Maoists, Rahul Musaki alias Pintu and Dalmati Kamar alias Madhuri, at the Reserve Police ground in Nuapada District. Following the ceremony, the Inspector-in-Charge of Jonk Police Station, Kailash Sethi, who acted as the bride&#39;s father, stated,</p>\n<p>\n\tWe are very happy to be a part of the former Maoist couple&#39;s wedding. All the officials of the police station and police outpost attended the wedding. We expect them to lead a life of an ideal couple. We hope this will set an example for other Maoists to join the mainstream soon and we will accept them with a warm welcome.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Nuapada District is located in the western part of Odisha with its boundaries extended in the north, west and south to the Raipur district of Chhattisgarh State, and in the east to Bargarh, Bolangir and Kalahandi Districts of Odisha. Nuapada is spread over an area of 3,852 square kilometres and was part of the undivided Kalahandi district till early March 1993. The present Nuapada District comprises one sub-division (Nuapada), five tehsils (Nuapada, Khariar, Komna, Boden and Sinapali) and five blocks (Khariar, Sinapalli, Boden, Nuapada and Komna). The plains of Nuapada subdivision are fringed with rugged hill ranges, stretching southward, into the main line of the Eastern Ghats, and contain extensive plateaus at about 4,000 feet (1,200 metres) in elevation, with long tropical grass growing over them. Specifically, the district shares its borders with Naxalite-affected Chhattisgarh to the north, west and south, making Nuapada an ideal spot for a guerrilla safe haven.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tSeven CRPF Companies (each of 135 personnel), along with three teams of the SOG, 33 DVF units, and six Indian Reserve Battalion and 18 Odisha Special Striking Force Battalion, are deployed in Nuapada to counter the rebels.</p>\n<p>\n\tMaoist violence in Nuapada had been contained over an extended period of time. The current spike is a warning that the rebels retain some residual capacities, and need a&nbsp; sustained effort by the SFs to secure&nbsp; an enduring peace in the district.</p>",

On August 15, 2017, Muslim insurgents calling themselves the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launch an assault on 30 Myanmar Police posts and an Army base in the north of the Rakhine State, in which nearly 80 insurgents and 12 members of the Security Forces were killed. As fighting intensified between the Myanmar Army and ARSA, thousands of Rohingyas fled to Bangladesh. Rohingya refugees had crossed the border and entered Bangladesh earlier as well, with significant spikes following violent attacks in 1978, 1991-1992, and again in 2016. As of October 2022, over 943,000 stateless Rohingya refugees were residing in the Ukhiya and Teknaf sub-districts of Cox&rsquo;s Bazar. The vast majority live in 34 extremely congested camps, including the largest single site, the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Unlawful activities have been increasing in the refugee camps due to the growing and active presence of organized gangs. According to an August 11, 2022, report, Rohingyas had formed at least 20 organised armed gangs, presently active in the refugee camps, prominently including the &lsquo;Salman Shah Group&rsquo;, &lsquo;Putia Group&rsquo;, &lsquo;Munna Group&rsquo;, &lsquo;Hakim Group&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Jokir Group&rsquo;. The gangs were involved in serious crimes such as arms, drugs and human trafficking, gold smuggling, kidnapping, extortion and killing. They were also involved in robberies, burglaries, cybercrime, sexual harassment as well as illegal SIM card and the hundi (money laundering) trade, as well as grabbing lands from Bangladeshi citizens. These organised Rohingya armed groups also run juvenile gangs.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tRecent reports indicate that the crime rate in the camps is increasing drastically. In an August 22, 2022, report, Cox&rsquo;s Bazar Police spokesperson Rafiqul Isla disclosed that, between August 25, 2017, and August 20, 2022, a total of 2,438 crimes had been registered in the Rohingya camps. These include 100 cases of murder &ndash; most of them carried out with knives or guns &ndash; 185 cases of possession of arms, 1,636 drug cases, 39 kidnappings, and 13 cases of attacks on Security Forces. A total of 5,226 refugees were charged for these crimes. Moreover, according to an October 1, 2021, report, criminal cases involving Rohingya refugees were increasing rapidly, with 75 cases in 2017; 208 in 2018; 263 in 2019; 184 in 2020; and 570 cases in the first eight months of 2021.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese gangs have created an alternate route for narcotics trafficking, particularly methamphetamine and Yaba tablets (a cocktail of methamphetamine and caffeine), through the Naikhyangchhari border in the Bandarban District, into the refugee camps, as the old Teknaf route has become difficult due to the &lsquo;zero tolerance&rsquo; policy and vigilance of the Bangladeshi government. Significantly, on June 9, 2021, marking the first use of capital punishment under the 2018 Narcotics Control Act in Bangladesh, Mohammad Arif, a 28-year-old Rohingya resident of Kutapalong Camp 2 in the Ukhiya Sector of Cox&rsquo;s Bazar, was sentenced to death by a lower court for the possession and smuggling of methamphetamine tablets. Although the charges brought against him would not normally warrant capital punishment, the Cox&rsquo;s Bazar Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdullah Al Mamun made an exception, deeming Arif&rsquo;s actions an attack on Bangladesh&rsquo;s security interests. In the verdict, Al Mamun thus stated, &ldquo;The defendant is a full grown, healthy, and normal person with discretion. He is fully aware of the provisions of Islam. Despite being sheltered in Bangladesh, the Rohingya Yabakarbari (Yaba trade) is trying to destroy the country by smuggling drugs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tApart from these criminal activities, ARSA, a virulent insurgent group based in Myanmar, is also finding its way into the refugee camps in Bangladesh. ARSA has created a group of at least 150 cadres inside the camps, and they were targeting Rohingya volunteers who were sharing information with the APBn of the Bangladesh Police and members of intelligence agencies about the movements and activities of the criminal gangs. On September 29, 2021, Rohingya leader and activist Mohib Ullah was brutally murdered at the Kutupalong camp, due to his ideological differences with, and protest against, ARSA. This was followed by a bloodbath unleashed by criminals on the Darul Ulum Nadwatul Ulama Al-Islamia Madrasa in Camp 18, with the killing of six Rohingyas, including madrasa chief Maulana Akiz, who also opposed ARSA.&nbsp; Later, on March 5, 2022, APBn arrested Zakaria, the &lsquo;chief commander&rsquo; of ARSA&rsquo;s Ulama branch, from the Lambasia Rohingya refugee camp in Ukhiya. According to Superintendent of Police (SP) Naimul Haque, Zakaria issued the &lsquo;fatwa&rsquo; for Mohib Ullah&rsquo;s assassination.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Unsurprisingly, as reported on August 29, stating that the efforts of the Bangladesh government were underway to repatriate the Rohingya refugees, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal added that Army troops would be deployed in the refugee camps, if necessary, to prevent crimes and check smuggling of drugs into the country. The Home Minister added, &quot;Mobile phones of the Rohingya refugees will be tracked so that they cannot commit any illegal activities.&quot; Regarding the government&#39;s efforts to resolve the Rohingya crisis, the Minister noted, &quot;I hope the Rohingyas will be repatriated soon. Government&#39;s efforts are still on.&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tIn the meantime, on October 17, a fresh batch of 963 Rohingyas reached Bhashan Char (an island in Noakhali District) in the 14th phase of resettlement within Bangladesh. With this, the total number of Rohingyas at the Bhashan Char reached 30,079, according to Lieutenant Hashem, in-charge of the Bhashan Char Rohingya Camp. In 2020, 306 Rohingyas who tried to go to Malaysia illegally by sea were rescued from the sea and taken to Bhashan Char. Many Rohingyas are not willing to settle on Bhashan Char, and reports indicate that some Rohingya drug cartels and extremist groups have taken a stand against repatriation to or rehabilitation in Bhasan Char, in order to keep their trafficking business alive.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Rohingya refugees residing in Bangladesh are causing serious law and order problems. With the news of a fresh wave of violence between the Arakan Army and Myanmar&rsquo;s military junta in the Rakhine province of Myanmar, the situation has become precarious, both in terms of the overflow of refugees as well as of diverse patterns of criminality and violence. In these circumstances, the pressure on the Bangladesh Government can only mount in view of the increasing criminal and terrorist activities emanating from the Rohingya refugee camps.</p>",

The deadline for the complete implementation of the scheme is 2024&ndash;2025. The UP government has allocated a budget of Rs 5,000 crore for this,&quot; he said.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Under this government scheme, which has been described as result-oriented, the Aggregate Technical and Commercial Loss (AT&amp;C) will decrease to 12-15 per cent. Apart from this, the average cost of supply and average revenue will be balanced and the power loss will be reduced to the barest minimum.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tChief Minister Yogi Adityanath has also directed the top Energy department officials to complete the final DPR and start the tendering process as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe update will also take into account the ongoing Deendayal Upadhyaya Yojana, Saubhagya and IPDS programmes. Under this, new power stations of 33-11 KV are to be built. Additionally, the generation capacities of the existing power stations with 33-11 KV capacity will be increased.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, 33 KV lines that are overloaded and those connected to multiple power stations will be separated. For this, separate new lines will be established. Similarly, the capacity of congested power stations will be increased and new distribution transformers will be installed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The scheme aims to provide 24 hours uninterrupted power supply to all the villages, towns and metros of the state. Moreover, in cases of a fault or breakdown affecting only one line, and to get rid of the problem of low voltage, an armoured service cable will be utilized for a safe power supply.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tIn addition, for error-free and timely electricity bills, smart prepaid meters will be installed according to the plan. Also, separate switches will be installed to monitor each feeder.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe government will also make funds available to the newly formed municipal bodies in the state under Mukhyamantri Nagar Srijan Yojana to strengthen the power supply network there.</p>",

New dimensions of security threats are emerging, that are becoming increasingly difficult to classify.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;We are facing such security threats, which fall into the category of non-kinetic and non-contact warfare. Cyber warfare and information warfare are such security threats,&quot; the minister said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&quot;Critical infrastructure like power generation and distribution is increasingly becoming more complex and reliant on networks of connected devices.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;The energy sector is one of the main targets of cyber-attacks against critical infrastructure, but it is not the only one. Transport, public sector services, telecommunications and critical manufacturing industries are also vulnerable,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking on dangers of information warfare in times of increasing use of social media the Minister said that it can threaten political stability.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;There is no account of how much fake news and hate material is likely to be brought into society through social media platforms.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;The organised use of social media and other online content generation platforms is being used for engineering the opinion or perspective of the masses,&quot; he said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tSingh said that the deployment of information war was most evident in the on-going conflict between Russia and Ukraine.</p>\n<p>\n\tRajnath Singh said that in order to counter these grave security challenges the comity of civilised nations need to work collectively.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;If security becomes a truly collective enterprise, then we can think of creating a global order which is beneficial to all of us.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;The global community has been working towards it and there exist a lot of multilateral organisations, working in the field of security like UNSC,&quot; the Defence Minister said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Minister said that the Russia-Ukraine conflict has fuelled an energy crisis in the world.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;In Europe, oil and gas supply has been dwindling. India has also been affected as the Russia-Ukraine war led to a disruption in international energy supply, making the energy import much more expensive,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tSingh said that Russia and Ukraine together export nearly a third of the world&#39;s wheat and barley. But this conflict had prevented grain from leaving the &#39;breadbasket of the world&#39; and led to food crisis in various African and Asian countries,&quot; the Minister added.</p>\n<p>\n\tSingh said that India believes in a multi-aligned policy which is realized through diverse engagements with multiple stakeholders, so that views and concerns of all can be discussed and addressed for a prosperous future for all.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;We should strive to create a win-win situation for all. We should not be guided by narrow self-interest which is not beneficial in the long-run, but by enlightened self-interest which is sustainable and resilient to shocks,&quot; he said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tSingh also said that a strong and prosperous India would not be built at the cost of others.</p>\n<p>\n\tRather, India is here to help other nations realise their full potential, he added.</p>",

India has reached here along with the history of many invaders and their tyranny. Those experiences are the biggest strength in India&#39;s development journey today. After independence we started a big journey starting from zero, aiming for the top. This includes the efforts of all the governments in the last 75 years.

The use of digital technology in development, inclusion, removal of corruption, improving ease of doing business and ease of living, can be templates for many countries.

The global economy is simply too inter-dependent for a significant conflict anywhere, not to have major consequences elsewhere,&quot; the minister added.</p>\n<p>\n\tDr Jaishankar said that India is clearly on the side of peace, respect for international law and support for the UN Charter. He said that for any initiative that de-risks the global economy and stabilizes the global order at this stage, India will be supportive.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;Insofar as specific initiatives pertaining to issues like food grains and fertilizer shipments are concerned, or any other problem for that matter, India will be as helpful as we can be,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Minister said that India and Russia have, in the last few years, grappled with how to expand bilateral trade and introduce more factors of long-term stability and growth.</p>\n<p>\n\tSome of these discussions are now yielding results, accelerated by the stresses that the global economy is currently experiencing, including as a result of the Ukraine conflict, he added.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>&quot;We are naturally concerned at the trade imbalance, and I have raised with the Russian side how to address impediments that stand in the way of greater Indian exports,&quot; the minister said.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, in response, accused the West of attempting to strengthen its dominant role in world affairs under the pretext of the Ukrainian events.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;For our part, we reaffirmed our high assessment of the Indian friends&#39; position on the situation in Ukraine and around it... We discussed the situation that has developed around the attempts of the Western colleagues, under the pretext of the Ukrainian events, to strengthen their dominant role in world affairs and prevent the democratization of international relations,&quot; Lavrov said.</p>\n<p>\n\tLavrov welcomed the &quot;positive dynamics&quot; of bilateral trade and said that the two countries would soon achieve the annual trade turnover to 30 billion USD.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;By September 2022, compared to the same period last year, the trade turnover added 133%, almost reaching the mark of 17 billion US dollars. We are sure that the goal set by the leaders of Russia and India to increase the annual trade turnover to 30 billion USD will be achieved soon,&quot; he said.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Talking about the factors of global instability, the EAM Jaishankar said, &quot;Terrorism, including its cross-border manifestation, remains a major concern. Where the Indo-Pacific is concerned, both our nations have stakes in its progress and prosperity.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe two countries also examined in detail the state of and prospects for military-technical cooperation and the joint production of modern types of weapons.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;We attach great importance to space exploration in such areas as satellite navigation, space science, and manned programs,&quot; Lavrov said.</p>\n<p>\n\tDr Jaishankar termed the talks as &quot;very open and productive exchanges&quot;, while the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov termed the talks as &quot;meaningful and useful talks in a traditionally friendly and frank manner.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t(With UNI inputs)</p>",

        "content": "<p>\n\tOn October 17, 2022, two migrant labourers were killed after terrorists hurled a grenade at their rented accommodation in the Hermain area of Shopian District. The victims were identified as Manish Kumar and Ram Sagar, both residents of Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh. The main attacker, Imran Bashir Ganie, a resident of Harmain, was arrested the same night. On his disclosures, his accomplice was arrested next morning. Both are &ldquo;hybrid&rdquo; terrorists of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).</p>\n<p>\n\tOn September 24, two non-local labourers were shot at and injured at Kharpora Ratnipora in Pulwama District. The injured labourers were identified as Shamshad and Faizan Qasri, residents of the Bettiah District of Bihar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>According to the South Asia Terrorism Portal (SATP), terrorists have targeted non-local labourers on at least 15 occasions in the current year, resulting in six fatalities and 33 persons injured, thus far (data till November 6). During the corresponding period of 2021, there were six such attacks, which resulted in six deaths and two persons injured. Though no such attack was reported in 2020, there were two attacks in 2019 after the &lsquo;abrogation&rsquo; of Article 370, on August 5, which resulted in five deaths and one person injured. In one attack, five migrant workers from the Murshidabad District of West Bengal were shot dead by terrorists in Kulgam District on October 29, while one non-local worker was injured in the second attack.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThus, since August 5, 2019, terrorists have targeted non-local labourers (from outside Jammu and Kashmir, J&amp;K) on at least 23 occasions killing 17 non-local workers and injuring another 36.</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, the terrorists also targeted people who have migrated to J&amp;K a long time back and had been staying there, in many cases, for decades. In one such attack on December 30, 2020, terrorists shot dead a 65-year-old jeweller, Satpal Nischal, in the Sarai Bala area of Srinagar. Though Nischal was not a &lsquo;State Subject&rsquo;, he had been living in J&amp;K for over 50 years, and had recently received his Domicile Certificate. Claiming the incident, The Resistance Front, declared, &ldquo;Domicile certificate is unacceptable and they shall be treated as occupiers.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn another such attack, a civilian, Akash Mehraj, was injured after terrorists opened fire on him in the Durganag area of Srinagar District on February 17, 2021. The Muslim Janbaz Force claimed the attack and warned, &ldquo;We will target those non-J&amp;K citizens who get a Domicile Certificate and those who will sell land to them and the property brokers involved in such deals.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tSignificantly, on March 31, 2020, the Centre changed the State Subject law and defined a new domicile rule for J&amp;K, according to which those who had lived in the Union Territory (UT) for 15 years or more would be eligible to receive a domicile certificate. Later, in a 54-page booklet released on the second anniversary of the &lsquo;abrogation&rsquo; of Article 370, the Government claimed that it had issued 441,000 domicile certificates. No further update in this regard is available.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Further, on October 27, 2020, the Centre notified the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Adaptation of Central Laws) Third Order, enabling a host of new changes, including no requirement of domicile or permanent resident certificate to purchase non-agricultural land in the UT. Previously, article 35-A of J&amp;K Constitution, watered down on August 5, 2019, along with Article 370, placed prohibitions on the sale of land to those who were not state subjects. On March 29, 2022, the Government informed the Parliament that &ldquo;as per the information provided by the government of Jammu and Kashmir, 34 people from outside the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir have bought properties in the UT of J&amp;K&rdquo; since the notification.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe current spurt in attacks on outsiders is at least partially connected to these changes, but can also be linked to the purportedly upcoming Assembly Elections in the UT.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Centre has made several reiterations in the recent past that Assembly Elections in J&amp;K would be held soon after the publication of revised electoral rolls. Simultaneously, widespread allegations started emerging that the Centre was trying to manipulate the rolls and bring in &#39;new&#39; non-local voters. Giving credence to such allegations, on August 17, 2022, Hirdesh Kumar, Chief Electoral Officer, J&amp;K and Ladakh, stated,</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter the abrogation of Article 370, many people who weren&#39;t voters in the Assembly can now be named on the voter&#39;s list to cast their vote... and no person needs to be a permanent resident of the state/UT. As per the provisions of the Representation of the Peoples Act, a person living ordinarily in the UT can avail of the opportunity to get enlisted as a voter in J&amp;K. He has to get enlisted as a voter and the ERO [Electoral Registration Officer] will take a final call on adding him/her in the voter list.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurther, on October 11, 2022, the Jammu administration issued an order authorising all tehsildars (revenue officials) to issue a certificate of residence to people residing in the district for more than one year. The purpose of the certificate of residence was to ensure that no eligible voter is left for registration in the ongoing special summary revision of electoral rolls. However, the order was withdrawn a day later.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>These developments were enough for the Establishment in Pakistan, which has for long been alleging that New Delhi was attempting to change the demography of J&amp;K, to attempt to orchestrate unrest in the UT. However, given the fact that Pakistan-backed terrorist groups and individuals/parties sympathetic to the Inter-Services Intelligence had been weakened considerably over time due to successful operations by the Security Forces, such orchestrated unrest remained unlikely. Realizing this, Islamabad-backed terrorist groups have resorted to the tactic of increased targeting of non-locals and persons who have long been residents in the UT, to instil fear and engineer an exodus before the upcoming elections.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tHaving created the situation without sufficient preparation or foresight, it is imperative that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union Government take adequate steps to ensure the safety and security of non-locals and persons long domiciled in the UT. Continuing failure to do so will hamper the prospect of restoration of sustainable normalcy in the UT, a precondition for the restoration of statehood and of any political reconciliation in foreseeable future. Terrorist violence has substantially been contained at a cost of great sacrifices by the Security Forces. Political sagacity is now needed to establish an enduring peace in this long-troubled region.</p>",

        "publishedAt": "November 07, 2022",
        "content": "<p>\n\tIt has little to do with any purported Khalistani resurgence, or with the supposed and &lsquo;complete breakdown of law and order&rsquo; under the Aam Admit Party (AAP) government in the state &ndash; the two tropes that are currently dominating media and political commentary on the issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile no significant disclosures have yet come from the police investigators, present indications are that Sandeep Singh aka Sunny, the accused in Suri&rsquo;s murder, acted on his own. However, some recoveries suggest he may have been &lsquo;inspired&rsquo; by the radical pro-Khalistan preacher Amritpal Singh, who presently heads Waris Punjab De (WPD, Heirs to Punjab), a group formed during the farmers&rsquo; agitation by actor and activist Deep Sidhu. Sidhu was killed in a road accident on February 15, 2022. Amritpal Singh took over a faction of WPD on September 29, 2022. However, initial disclosures indicate that Sandeep Singh was &lsquo;self-radicalized&rsquo;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Significantly, according to police sources, because of his provocative statements Suri had been on the hit list of almost every terrorist module that had been arrested in the recent past, including those responsible for the rocket propelled grenade (RPG) attack on the Punjab Police Intelligence Headquarters at Mohali on May 9, 2022. However, an approach by these organized groups was difficult, given the significant security Suri had been provided by the police.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tHowever, Sandeep Singh was able to secure access because he was familiar to most people in the Majitha Road locality, where he had a shop, and was consequently able to approach and attack Suri. He used a .32 bore licensed weapon to kill Suri in broad daylight, in the presence of a large contingent of Police, including the personnel provided for his own protection, as well as a local Deputy Superintendent of Police and a Station House Officer, who were trying to get Suri to end his protest outside the Gopal Mandir on the crowded Majitha Road in Amritsar.</p>\n<p>\n\tAn unverified post on social media, purportedly by Canada-based Punjab-origin gangster Lakhbir Singh aka Landa aka Landa Harike claiming responsibility for the Suri killing has been given little credence by the police, though &lsquo;every angle is being investigated&rsquo;. Landa has also been associated with the Pakistan-based Harvinder Singh aka Rinda, of the banned Khalistani terrorist formation, Babbar Khalsa International (BKI). Rinda is an aide to BKI &lsquo;chief&rsquo; Wadhawa Singh Babbar, also located in Pakistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe investigations into the Suri killing are at an early stage, and little that is definitive could be said about Sundeep Singh&rsquo;s motivation and affiliations at this stage. Reports suggest that personal animus may be the principal provocation for the murder.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>It is, nevertheless, useful to address the flood of falsehoods that are creating the impression of a security breakdown and &lsquo;resurgence&rsquo; of the Khalistani movement in the State, as well as of AAP &lsquo;failure&rsquo; in this regard, propaganda principally fueled by &lsquo;losers&rsquo; in the Punjab Assembly elections of February 2022 &ndash; the Congress Party, the Akali Dal, and the Bharatiya Janata Party. AAP swept the elections, winning 92 of 117 seats.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tCrucially, there has not been a single fatality directly linked to Khalistani terrorism in 2022, till date, unless the Suri killing eventually comes to be categorized as such. Two incidents, prior to the Suri killing, have most frequently been cited as evidence of the &lsquo;breakdown of law and order&rsquo; in Punjab &ndash; the killing of popular singer Shubhdeep Singh Sidhu aka Sidhu Moosewala on May 29, 2022; and the rocket propelled grenade (RPG) attack on the Punjab Police Intelligence Headquarters at Mohali on May 9, 2022. There were no casualties in the latter incident, which was traced back to Lakhbir Singh aka Landa, and Harvinder Singh aka Rinda. The Sidhu Moose Wala killing, moreover, was essentially a gangland rivalry between the Devinder Bambiha group and the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, and had been preceded by a succession of tit-for-tat killings over the past years. Bishnoi&rsquo;s Canada-based associate Satwinderjit Singh aka Goldy Brar claimed responsibility for the killing in a video message posted on social media.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile both incidents were serious, they are far from representative of any abrupt collapse of administration after the AAP government came to power. Indeed, past years have seen several incidents directly linked to Khalistani terrorism &ndash; most of them connected with elements in the extremist fringe of the Sikh Diaspora. Significantly, there were no Khalistan terrorism-linked fatalities between 2008 and 2015, but each year between 2016 and 2021 recorded one or more such killings, including a spate of nine targeted killings and at least another four failed attempts in 2016 and 2017, by a single two-man cell, tied in to conspirators in the UK and Pakistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tNor, indeed, is Punjab particularly high in the list of states in terms of &lsquo;normal&rsquo; violent crime (crimes not involving terrorists or gangs). The National Crime Records Bureau&rsquo;s Crime in India 2021 report indicates that Punjab registered 362 firearms-related cases, out of a total of 44,789 cases nationwide, while Uttar Pradesh accounted for as many as 26,530 such case. Between 2016 and 2020, Punjab recorded 1.4 arms and explosives related case per year per 100,000 population, as against a national average at 4.8 cases per 100,000, and a high of 14 case per 100,000 in Madhya Pradesh, 13 per 100,000 in Uttar Pradesh, and nine per 100,000 in Delhi.</p>\n<p>\n\tData for 2021 and 2022 is not yet publicly available. However, on April 11, 2022, the then Director General of Police (DGP), Punjab, Viresh K. Bhawra, disclosed that, since January 1, 2022, 16 modules of criminal gangs had been neutralized, and 98 arrests had been made in this connection. Six gang-related murders had been recorded in the state in the first quarter of the year, and 24 accused had been arrested in these cases. Further, Bhawra stated that the first quarter of 2022 had seen an average of 50 murders per month, as compared to an average of 60 per month in 2021 and 65 in 2020.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Further, Bhawra added, of 545 &#39;A&#39;, &#39;B&#39; and &#39;C&#39; category gangsters in the state, effective action had been taken against 515 over the preceding years, while 30 were yet to be arrested. Eight gangsters had been gunned down in encounters, prominently including Vicky Gounder, Prema Lahoria and Jaipal, during the tenure of Captain Amarinder Singh as Chief Minister. Many of the gangsters had shifted their base out of Punjab as a result of effective police action.</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThere is no indication of any radical departure from these trends in 2022, or since AAP took over.</p>\n<p>\n\tNone of this is, of course, intended to suggest that all is well in Punjab.</p>\n<p>\n\tPerhaps the most troubling development in this context is the increased coordination between criminal gangs and Khalistani terrorists, coordinated by terrorist and gang leaders located abroad, to engineer acts of terrorism, as well as to run drug-extortion-target killing operations in Punjab. The role of Pakistan&rsquo;s Inter Services Intelligence is particularly visible in these evolving networks, and in the veritable explosion of drone borne &lsquo;composite consignments&rsquo; &ndash; consignments of drugs and weapons &ndash; that are being dropped into Punjab with increasing frequency. According to an October 12, 2022, report, Security Forces (SFs) have observed the illegal entry of at least 171 drones across the India-Pakistan border along the Punjab sector from Pakistan, in the first nine months of the year. Several such flights are likely to have escaped observation along Punjab&rsquo;s 425 kilometre-long border with Pakistan. In addition to other avenues of smuggling, this would indicate a significant build-up of a reserve of weapons and ammunition available to gang and terrorist combine in Punjab, adding enormously to the potential security risk in the state.</p>\n<p>\n\tSignificant action has been taken recently against the flood of drugs in the State. On October 31, 2022, the Punjab Police disclosed that it had arrested 6,997 drug smugglers and registered a total of 5,346 First Information Report (FIR)s in the preceding four months in its ongoing drive against narcotics. Police recovered close to 260 kilograms of heroin from across the state, in addition to 300 kilograms of opium, 197.2 kilograms of ganja (marijuana), 293 quintals of poppy husk, and 27,56,000 tablets, capsules, injections and vials of pharmaceutical opioids from across the state.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt is useful to remind ourselves, here, that the organized crime &ndash; terrorism linkage has a downside for the Khalistanis as well. There is tremendous anger against the drug trade in Punjab, with thousands of families facing ruination as a result of addiction of some of their members. Other gang activities &ndash; extortion, kidnapping and murders &ndash; can only further delegitimize those associated with such groups, and the Khalistanis cannot escape this consequence. As pretenders to a noble religious tradition, their complicity in such crimes and association with such gangs cannot be reconciled with their projections as defenders of the Faith.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, a dramatic growth of religious radicalization &ndash; globally, nationally and within Punjab &ndash; is an increasingly manifest reality. Within Punjab, the Khalistan movement has periodically reminded us of its existence through occasional acts of terrorism as well as reports of arrests, seizures of weapons and a range of subversive and propaganda activities. However, there is evidence that the extremists have found little or fitful traction on the ground. Very few among those involved in the occasional acts of terrorism have been ideologically driven, some of them were not even Sikhs, and most have been mercenaries linked to criminal gangs.</p>\n<p>\n\tNevertheless, there is a rising flood or Khalistani propaganda, particularly on social media, and indications that the idea of Khalistan may once again find some resonance among the youth, particularly in Sikh Diaspora communities, but also within Punjab. Moreover, activities of radical &lsquo;influencers&rsquo; such as Amritpal Singh, and his ambition to establish units of his faction of WPD across the villages and towns of Punjab, are setting off alarm bells in the security establishment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>It is useful, however, to remind ourselves constantly that Hindu and Sikh extremism are feeding off one another, creating an atmosphere fraught with danger. Communal polarization and hate speech have become deeply entrenched in electoral politics at every level, finding their strident echoes in the bedlam of social media. This can only bode ill for the security of the state and of the nation.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tCrucially, individuals and groups such as Sudhir Suri&rsquo;s Shiv Sena (Taksali) and its mirror Khalistani extremist formations need to be brought under the constraints of law with far greater urgency than is presently the case. The Punjab Police has now set up a committee to examine the security of 16 Hindu leaders and VVIPs in the state. While such a measure is necessary, particularly in view of the abrupt reduction of the security details for several persons, including Sidhu Moose Wala immediately before his killing, there is an equally urgent need to review the provision of police security to communal provocateurs who seek to incite hatred between communities, and to orchestrate violence in the state.</p>",

It also issues directions for the revival of dormant riot cases.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Supreme Court&#39;s three-judge bench, headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, and also comprising Justices Abhay Sreeniwas Oka and Vikram Nath passed these directions while disposing of a petition filed by Shakeel Ahmed in 2001, seeking implementation of the recommendations of the Justice (Retired) Sri B N Srikrishna Committee report, which was constituted by the State Government to probe into the riots.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;There was a failure on the part of the State government to maintain law and order and to protect the rights of the people guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution,&quot; the Supreme Court in its 38-page judgement said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe apex court also noted in its verdict and said that 900 persons died and more than 2,000 were injured. The houses, places of business and properties of the citizens were destroyed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese are all violations of their rights. One of the root causes of their suffering was the failure of the state government to maintain law and order.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe court also hoped that riot situations never occur in India in future, it said that if such unfortunate events take place in future, legal services authorities would come to the rescue of the victims.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;We hope and trust that after 75 years of independence, riot-like situations will never arise. Unfortunately, if such situations arise, we are sure that the Legal Services Authorities at various levels will come to the rescue of the victims of violence and render legal services to them,&quot; the Supreme Court said, in its verdict.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe state government shall pay compensation of Rs.2 lakhs to the legal heirs of the missing persons traced out with interest at the rate of 9 per cent per annum from January 22, 1999, the top court said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe entire exercise of payment of compensation and interest shall be completed by the State government within a period of nine months, from today, the top court said.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The state government shall provide details of the only pending riot criminal case before the sessions court at Mumbai to the Registrar General (RG) of the Bombay High Court, who shall bring it to the notice of the concerned court that the case needs to be disposed of at the earliest, the Supreme Court made it clear.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe apex court also said that the state government disclosed to it the status of 253 riot cases. 114 cases resulted in acquittal. There were 6 convictions, one case got abated and 34 cases were found unrelated to riots. One case is still pending while 97 cases are lying dormant.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt said that the State government shall provide details of 97 cases on dormant files to the RG of the Bombay HC within one month from today.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn receipt of the details, the HC on the administrative side shall issue necessary communication to the concerned courts in which, the cases are pending to take necessary steps.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The state government shall immediately constitute a special cell to trace the absconding/ missing accused in these cases and to assist the concerned courts so that the trial can proceed against them.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe state government shall expeditiously implement all the recommendations made by the Commission on the issue of reforms in the police force which were accepted by the state.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Justice Srikrishna, who retired as SC judge, was appointed to head the commission to inquire into the riots that shook Mumbai.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tAt that time, he was a sitting judge of the Bombay High Court.</p>\n<p>\n\tJustice Srikrishna Commission of Inquiry was constituted by the government of Maharashtra for investigating the causes of the Bombay riots.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe apex court was hearing a batch of petitions filed since 1998 seeking direction for the implementation of recommendations made in the Srikrishna commission report and providing adequate compensation to the family members of the deceased and affected ones.</p>",

Nandini Singla; and other eminent personalities attended the commemorative activity.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;The event comprised a wreath-laying ceremony by the Prime Minister and other dignitaries; cultural and artistic items highlighting the historical legacy of the Indentured Labourers; and the launching of the annual Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund magazine,&quot; read a statement issued by the Mauritius government.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>In his keynote speech, the Prime Minister saluted the courage, perseverance, sufferings, sacrifices, efforts, resilience and patience of the Indentured Labourers, underlining their immense contributions to the socioeconomic development of the Republic of Mauritius.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Head of Government recalled that some 462,000 immigrants came to Mauritius from India between 1834 and 1920, seeking a better life, and had, upon their arrival, faced tough challenges and appalling conditions that denied them their humanity.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe talked, too, of the significance of the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site, where 188 years ago, some 36 Indian immigrants, after their journey on board the M.V. Atlas, climbed the flights of 16 steps with the objective of creating a future for themselves and their children.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the Prime Minister, the history of indentured workers was one of the most inspirational chapters of Mauritian history.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe, thus, stressed the imperative for the population, in general, and the young generations, in particular, to learn their common history and of the life of their forebears, and to visit the historical sites across the island.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Jugnauth put forward the harsh experiences of the previous generations who struggled, sweated and toiled with great dignity, and succeeded, against all odds, in paving the way for the development and prosperity of the country.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Our story is the continuation of their history,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister also honoured all the historical figures who fought throughout decades for the human, social, political, religious and cultural rights of all to be recognised and respected.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe moreover paid tribute to the people who were instrumental in the preservation of the historical legacy and site, namely the contribution of late Dr Corrine Forrest in the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund and in the promotion of the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, the population was invited by Mr Jugnauth to work together and to persevere in building unity amidst the diversity and multicultural aspects that were the hallmarks of the Mauritian nation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister urged everyone to live in peace and harmony, while being proud of their ancestors and remembering the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the Minister of Arts and Cultural Heritage, Mr Avinash Teeluck, he invited the audience to cast their mind back to the time of the arrival of the first Indentured Labourers, and to reflect on their living and working conditions.</p>\n<p>\n\tTeeluck spoke as well of the wreath laying ceremony that was held on 1st November 2022 at Antoinette Phooliyar in Barlow where the first 36 Indian Immigrants lived after their arrival in Mauritius.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The Minister announced that an indentured village would be constructed at Antoinette Phooliyar in Barlow to present a living picture of the indentured experience. He indicated that thorough research had been undertaken and was ongoing to deliver a factual rendition of life and circumstances at that time.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFor her part, the High Commissioner of the Republic of India dwelt upon the prominent and active role of the Indian Diaspora in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tShe affirmed that Mauritius epitomised the spirit of the Pravasi Bhartiya Divas, and seized the opportunity to invite people from Mauritius to participate in the 17th Pravasi Bhartiya Divas which would be hosted in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, in India, in January 2023. The Pravasi Bhartiya Divas is celebrated on 09 January, to commemorate the date of the return of Mahatma Gandhi from South Africa to India in 1915 and highlight the contribution of the overseas Indian community to the development of India.</p>",

This resulted in direct benefits to the poor people of Delhi, including street vendors.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also commented on the ubiquitous penetration of UPI. More than 50 thousand street vendors received financial assistance under the SVANidhi scheme.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>The Prime Minister said, &ldquo;We are ensuring &#39;Ease of Living&#39; for the poor in Delhi through &#39;One Nation, One Ration Card&#39;.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThis proved hugely beneficial for poor segments during the pandemic. Lakhs of eligible vulnerable people are receiving free ration from the central government for the last two years. In Delhi only, more than 2.5 thousand crore Rupees were spent on this, he informed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister continued and informed that more than 40 lakh poor people in Delhi got the security of insurance. Medical expenses were brought down through Jan Aushadhi Schemes.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;When there is this security in life, the poor work hard with all their might without rest. He works to lift himself out of poverty,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister said that all this is done with much fanfare and expansive advertisements.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is because &ldquo;we live to bring change in your lives,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking on the topic of unauthorised colonies in Delhi the Prime Minister acknowledged the constant worry of the people about the status of their houses.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The central government has also done the work of reducing this concern of the people of Delhi. Work is going on to regularise the houses built in unauthorised colonies of Delhi through the PM-UDAY scheme. Till now thousands of people have taken advantage of this scheme,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also mentioned that 700 crore rupees have been spent in providing interest subsidies to poor and middle-class families for constructing their own houses.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Our government is leaving no stone unturned to fulfil the aspirations of citizens in Delhi. The aim of the central government is to turn Delhi into a grand city complete with all amenities in accordance with its status as the capital of the country,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tReferring to his talk of &lsquo;aspirational society&rsquo; from the ramparts of Red Fort, the Prime Minister said Delhi&rsquo;s poor and middle class is both aspirational and talented.</p>\n<p>\n\tEmphasising the development in the Delhi NCR region, the Prime Minister informed about the expansion of metro routes from 190 km to 400 km after 2014.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe further noted that in the last 8 years, 135 new metro stations have been added to the network which ended up saving time and money. The Prime Minister also informed that the Government of India with an investment of Rs. 50 thousand crores is widening roads to provide relief to Delhi from traffic congestion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>The Prime Minister gave examples of Dwarka Expressway, Urban Extension Road, Akshardham to Baghpat 6-lane Access Control Highway and elevated corridor in the form of Gurugram-Sohna Road.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister informed that services like Rapid Rail for Delhi NCR are going to begin in the near future.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe noted the grand construction of the New Delhi Railway Station that is going to take place and expressed delight at the construction of Bharat Vandana Park on 80 hectares of land in Dwarka which is now moving towards completion in the next few months.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I am told that over 700 big parks in Delhi are maintained by the DDA. Various parks are being developed by DDA on the 22 km stretch between Wazirabad barrage to Okhla barrage,&rdquo; he informed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister asked the beneficiaries of the new houses to use LED bulbs only to save electricity, to make sure no water gets wasted and most importantly to keep the entire colony clean and beautiful.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe noted that today the government of India is building houses for crores of poor people, supplying water through taps, providing electricity connections, Ujjwala cylinders, and so we have to break the age-old misconception that slums are associated with filth.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I am sure everyone will continue to play a leading role in the development of Delhi and the country. With the contribution of every citizen, the journey of Delhi and India&rsquo;s development will reach new heights&rdquo;, the Prime Minister concluded.</p>",

Rossouw had scored a magnificent century against Bangladesh in the T20 World Cup.</p>\n<p>\n\tOther batters in the top five other than Suryakumar and Babar are Mohammad Rizwan, Devon Conway and Aiden Markram.

        "content": "<p>\n\tHe will continue with the MI family in his new role as batting coach.</p>\n<p>\n\tA one-club man, adorning the Blue and Gold, Pollard signed in 2010 for Mumbai Indians and has since become one of the greatest players of this generation, picking up 5 IPL and 2 champions league trophies with Mumbai Indians.</p>\n<p>\n\tPollard is and will continue to always be at #MIForever and will use his decades of experience and skill to strengthen Mumbai Indians as a batting coach and as a player with MI Emirates.</p>\n<p>\n\tNita. M. Ambani, said &ldquo;For me, Pollard has exemplified what Mumbai Indians stand for &ndash; Khelenge Dil Khol Ke! Right from Season 3, we have shared joy, sweat, and tears &ndash; those powerful emotions that forge lifelong bonds on and off the field. He has played an important role in the success of MI and been a part of the winning side for both our Champions League trophies and all 5 IPL wins. We will miss seeing his magic on the field for MI, but I&rsquo;m delighted that he will continue to play for MI Emirates, and also mentor young players as the batting coach for MI. May his new journey with MI and MI Emirates bring him even greater glory, triumph, and fulfilment. I wish him all the very best!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tAkash Ambani, said &ldquo;Polly leaves behind a huge legacy as a player with Mumbai Indians. Fans roared every time he took to the field. A valued member of the MI family and a great friend, he played the beautiful game of cricket with utmost commitment and passion all through his IPL career with us. Pleased to have Polly continue to be a part of the MI Family as a batting coach for Mumbai Indians and as player with MI Emirates. We believe, Polly will be as dynamic and impactful as a coach, just like the way he was, when he took to the field for us. His insights will be invaluable to the team, though the Mumbai Indians, Wankhede Stadium and the Paltan will miss him play on the field.</p>\n<p>\n\tKieron Pollard, said &ldquo;It hasn&rsquo;t been the easiest decision to make as I will keep playing for a few more years, but I understand that this incredible franchise which has achieved so much needs to transition and if I&rsquo;m no longer to play for MI then I cannot see myself playing against MI either. Once an MI always an MI. I am immensely proud, honoured and blessed to have represented the biggest and most successful team in the IPL for the past 13 seasons. Most sincerely, I express my deep appreciation to Mukesh, Nita and Akash Ambani for their tremendous love, support and respect I have always felt and for the confidence they placed in me. I recall our first encounter when they welcomed me with open arms saying, &ldquo;We are family&rdquo;. Those were not just mere words, but demonstrated by their every action throughout my time with Mumbai Indians.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tFondly called &ldquo;Polly&rdquo; by team-mates and fans alike, he made his debut for Mumbai Indians in 2010 and since then has been one of the key figures in the dressing room and on the field. He played 211&nbsp; games (IPL + CLT20), scoring 3915 runs, at a strike rate of 147 and despite playing in the middle order, is currently 18th on the list of IPL&rsquo;s highest run getters with 3412 runs. His bowling prowess was time and again called upon, bringing to the game, a sense of control, scalping 79 wickets, with 69 of those in the IPL, making him an all-rounder for youngsters to aspire to be. With 103 catches in the IPL, he has been a match winner, game changer, big moment player, an able deputy and stepping up to captain at times, contributing with his sharp fielding and his stride to the middle, was a joy to behold.</p>\n<p>\n\tKey Highlights from Kieron Pollard&rsquo; illustrious IPL career</p>\n<p>\n\t2ndHighest Run Getter For Mumbai Indians &ndash; 3915</p>\n<p>\n\tMost Sixes For Mumbai&nbsp; Indians in IPL&nbsp; &ndash; 223</p>\n<p>\n\t3rdMost number of catches taken in the IPL by a non-wicket keeper - 103</p>\n<p>\n\t5thmost Man of the Match Awards for an overseas player &ndash; 14</p>\n<p>\n\t2nd joint fastest 50 For Mumbai Indians &ndash; 17 Balls</p>\n<p>\n\t2ndHighest Batting strike rate for Mumbai Indians (Min 300 Runs) &ndash; 147.32</p>\n<p>\n\t180 Runs In Six IPL Finals at a strike rate of 195.65</p>"

I came out and played a great match, and I couldn&#39;t be happier.&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFritz improved to 2-2 in his ATP Head2Head series against Nadal, backing up his win in the Indian Wells final in March -- a match the American nearly didn&#39;t play due to an ankle injury.</p>\n<p>\n\tNadal, who was playing in his second ATP Tour singles match since the US Open, has now suffered three straight defeats, all against Americans.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe was turned back by Frances Tiafoe at the US Open and Tommy Paul two weeks ago in Paris before Sunday&#39;s loss at the hands of Fritz.</p>"

Against India in the semi-final we saw it, against Sri Lanka when they had to win to qualify and then in the final, they were dominant.&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tSammy lauded allrounder Ben Stokes who was beaten by the Pakistan bowlers in the middle but that didn&#39;t dampen the English cricketer&#39;s spirit.</p>\n<p>\n\tStokes counter-attacked Pakistan to script the victory for his team.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;I am absolutely chuffed for Ben Stokes. He was like a sponge, he absorbed the pressure for England, he absorbed, absorbed and absorbed and then you squeeze and release. That was Ben Stokes in that chase,&quot; Sammy, the two-time T20 World Cup winning skipper, said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/sports_pic/2022/b32e76f8d0040bd8634c9d6c6993500e1.jpg' alt='Daren Sammy | Image Credit: Twitter/Daren Sammy' class='article-image'/><span class='photo-courtsey'>Daren Sammy | Image Credit: Twitter/Daren Sammy</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"color:#990000;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>Read Sammy&#39;s entire column</strong></span></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tI think it&rsquo;s not fair to him that the one defining over in the 2016 final will always be remembered when you talk about the T20 World Cup finals. Since then, he has soared high like an eagle. With the bat, especially, he has had so many great moments in all three formats.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat over and the Carlos Brathwaite sixes will be one of the first things you think of when you look back on T20 World Cup finals. It will not be the first thing you think of when it comes to Ben Stokes though. That is a mark of everything he has achieved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tI am so happy for him that he stood up in the final. It&rsquo;s not the first time he has done it. It tells you the mark of a great player because you always find yourself in a position to be a hero for your team. That is what Ben Stokes has done.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs great as he was though, the strength of this England team is just how many people contribute. That is why they are a great team.</p>\n<p>\n\tSam Curran has that ability to put the choke on the opposition and take key wickets in the middle overs. Every time they look like they might be building a partnership, he comes on and takes a couple of quick wickets.</p>\n<p>\n\tPraise also has to go to Chris Jordan who came in for the big games and got key wickets.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tPakistan were always up against it when they lost the toss and batted first. That does not play to their strengths.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey want to bowl first, restrict the opposition and then let Mohammad Rizwan and Babar Azam go out and chase.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe saw that they were too tentative batting first. You need to be brave in the power play and put teams under pressure earlier.</p>\n<p>\n\tCommiserations to Pakistan though, who overcame all the odds to get to the final and they were not too far away in the end. But England won it and they deserved it.</p>\n<p>\n\tI think the other thing this tournament has shown us is that while the teams are definitely getting closer, the players with experience of playing in T20 leagues around the world really shone.</p>\n<p>\n\tYou look at India, who have the biggest T20 league, but their players do not have the experience of the guys who are playing all over the world. You look at guys like Alex Hales, Chris Jordan, guys who play in the Big Bash. It is no coincidence that they excelled in Australia.</p>\n<p>\n\tEngland have always been able to adapt to what the situation required. Whether it was against Afghanistan in Perth, they did what they needed to get the win. Against Sri Lanka and New Zealand, they upped the tempo when necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThen, in the final, they only needed a victory and to chase 137, and they did it. That is maturity in a batting line-up, understanding what you need to do and playing accordingly. They were the most adaptable team with bat and ball and they are worthy winners.</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tThe unbeaten opening stand of 170 between Jos Buttler and Alex Hales is the highest for any wicket in the T20 World Cup and the ruthless display from the duo saw England cruise to a win in 16 overs.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the target was possibly never too high for England in reality on this Adelaide wicket and Dravid agreed that India were quite a few runs short with the bat.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;We were one of those teams that were, even in these conditions, scoring 180, 180 plus. I think we had done it two or three times in this tournament. So we were playing well.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&quot;It&#39;s just, I think, maybe when the game started, the boys were saying it was a little bit tacky, it was a little bit slower. Having said that, they bowled really well. I thought they were really good up front,&quot; said Dravid.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;They hit really good lengths, and didn&#39;t really let us get away. We felt at that 15-over mark we felt we were probably 15, 20 short, and we really had a good last five overs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;I think Hardik out there was absolutely brilliant, but in the end it looked like we were a lot shorter than even 15, 20, but I think we should have been able to get to 180, 185 on that wicket. Maybe things might have been different with an early wicket after that,&quot; Dravid said in a post-match press conference here.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tDravid said the pitch played into England&#39;s hands as the ball did not swing at the Oval here and lauded the murderous opening wicket partnership which pushed India out of the game.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;The ball didn&#39;t swing here probably as much as it has in other parts of Australia or in other conditions. Played a little bit into their hands, and class players like that, both Buttler and Hales, I thought their partnership was fantastic today,&quot; he said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&quot;I think they just put the pressure on us, never let that go, and even when our spinners came on on a wicket that we thought we might be able to control the game, they really counterattacked our spinners, as well, and put our spinners under a lot of pressure,&quot; Dravid added.</p>"

I believe that he likes to see big gaps, and that&#39;s where his strength is.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Speaking about his forearm, Rohit said that his hand has &quot;a little bruising, but it&#39;s absolutely fine now&quot; after copping a knock while batting in the nets at the SCG on Tuesday and needing close attention before returning to face more balls.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tBut the India skipper was tight-lipped on whether Rishabh Pant might hold his spot in the playing XI for the semifinal after the left-hander replaced veteran Dinesh Karthik for their final Super 12 match.</p>\n<p>\n\tPant made three runs against Zimbabwe, while fellow keeper-batter Karthik has averaged 4.67 runs in three innings at the T20 World Cup.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;Rishabh was the only guy who didn&#39;t get to play on this tour at all except the two games that we played in Perth. That was an unofficial practice game,&quot; Rohit said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&quot;We wanted to give him some time and have some options as well, if we want to make changes in the semis or the finals.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;It was a little tactical as well, considering we were not knowing which team we would be playing in the semis before that Zimbabwe game, so we wanted to just give a left-hander an opportunity to counter some of the spinners who bowled in the middle for New Zealand and England.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;What is going to happen tomorrow, I won&#39;t be able to tell you right now, but both of the keepers will be in play for sure.&quot;</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tThe 33-year-old has played for his country 229 times in all formats since he made his debut back in 2007 and he brings the curtain down on this chapter in his life having represented Scotland at an amazing five full World Cups and one under-19 World Cup.</p>\n<p>\n\tCalum played in one 50-over World Cup in 2015 in Australia and New Zealand and four T20 World Cups in 2009 in England, 2016 in India, 2021 in Oman and the UAE and 2022 in Australia, these coming all came after his involvement at the under-19 World Cup in Sri Lanka in 2006.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe played in 88 One Day Internationals for Scotland between 2008 and 2022, scoring 3,026 runs and taking 11 wickets.</p>\n<p>\n\tOut of those runs, he made 10 centuries and 13 50s, including 175 against Canada in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2014, 157 not out in Bulawayo in Zimbabwe against Afghanistan in 2018 and 140 not out versus England at The Grange, Edinburgh, in 2018.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis highest score with the bat in T20 internationals was 74 against Bermuda in Dubai in 2019 while his six other half centuries in the format came versus the Netherlands (twice), Kenya, Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Ireland. However, for Scottish fans, his unbeaten 140 versus England at the Grange in 2018 will go down as one of the greatest batting performances in the history of Scottish cricket.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Reflecting on his decision, MacLeod said: &ldquo;Having announced my retirement to the team a few days ago, I&rsquo;m sitting here thinking back to what inspired me in the first place and that would be the Scotland versus Australia game at the 1999 World Cup.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I remember watching that and thinking &lsquo;that is what I want to do&rsquo; and it lit a fire inside me to go on and do everything I could to play for Scotland.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;So, to fast forward to now as I step back having played in five World Cups, I think if you&rsquo;d told me way back then what I&rsquo;d go on to achieve with my country, I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed you.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Finishing after this World Cup in Australia has been tough because we didn&rsquo;t manage to achieve what we wanted to achieve, but I leave the group with a real sense of hope that, with the right backing and the right opportunities, the current team can really go far and can inspire many.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>&ldquo;There are too many people who have helped me over the years to thank them all personally now, but I&rsquo;d like to thank all the coaches, all the staff, all the captains, all the players and all the people at Cricket Scotland who have been involved during my time with the national team.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;They have trusted me and they have given me the opportunity and the platform to go out there and perform at the highest level.</p>\n<div>\n\t<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n\t\t\t&ldquo;I just want to say thank you to you all and I hope I repaid the faith you showed in me&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/calummacleod640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@calummacleod640</a> announces his retirement from international cricket <a href=\"https://t.co/94CsCNvNFB\">https://t.co/94CsCNvNFB</a> 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/followscotland?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#followscotland</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/K7KuVmJ60d\">pic.twitter.com/K7KuVmJ60d</a></p>\n\t\t&mdash; Cricket Scotland (@CricketScotland) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/1588559123628507137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 4, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\t<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n\t</script>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I just want to say thank you to you all and I hope I repaid the faith you showed in me.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;My career with Scotland has been filled with some real highs and a few lows, I feel extremely fortunate to have played for my country 229 times. It was something that I never took for granted and it was a huge honour and a privilege. I hope I have entertained a few people along the way and, ultimately, I feel like I am leaving the team in a better place than when I started this amazing journey.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;So, to everybody that has supported me in any way throughout my time in a Scotland shirt thank you, I simply could not have done it without you.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tCalum&rsquo;s impressive list of accolades and records was augmented in 2018 when he named Associate Player of the Year and then again in 2020 being nominated for Associate Player of the Decade.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Commenting on Calum&rsquo;s career, Scotland Men&rsquo;s Head Coach Shane Burger said &ldquo;I am Incredibly sad to see his career end particularly in the fashion it did with us bowing out of the World Cup in the first round as it would not have been how Calum would have wanted.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;For me personally, Calum leaves a great legacy behind him in not only the runs he scored including ten ODI hundreds, but also his desire to put in performances in the earlier part of his career when he was a bowler and had to transition into a batter. He is an incredibly talented sportsman, a fantastic fielder, a real fighter and someone who would front up when it was required. Those were his characteristics, and he can hold his head really high as he has left Scottish cricket in a better place.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We wish him all the best in his future career and we know he has all the skills and attributes to be really successful and I know he will continue to impact on many people&rsquo;s lives. We will miss him but respect his decision and wish him well in his journey.&rdquo;</p>"

Shadab Khan prized out Milton Shumba before Sean Williams and Sikandar Raza went about the resurrection work.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tThings turned south pretty quickly when Shadab sent back Williams and Chakabva off successive deliveries, the latter dismissed off a spectacular grab at first slip by Babar Azam.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tShadab completed a brilliant spell of 4-0-23-3 but there was more in store for Zimbabwe from the other end.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the very next over after losing two wickets off back-to-back balls to Shadab, Zimbabwe lost a further two as Mohammad Wasim dismissed Raza and Luke Jongwe off successive balls.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom 95/3, and what appeared to be a solid start, quickly turned into 95/7 as Pakistans bowlers went on a rampage in Perth.</p>\n<p>\n\tEventually, they put up 130/8 on board with some help from Brad Evans down the order.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt seemed unlikely to be enough but a superb bowling display from Zimbabwe ensured otherwise.</p>"

Um, if it gets any better than that, were in for an amazing three weeks.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tIndia v Pakistan is always an incredible game to watch. I cant imagine what it would be like to have been in that crowd and to be a part of it.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tMarsh also praised Kohli, whose innings was lauded by the entire cricket world.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, Kohli was showered with congratulatory messages after he remarkably won the match, which was in the full grip of Pakistan.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tBut yeah. Amazing. Virat Kohli has been through an indifferent 12 months when you think about his career.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tAnd for him to do that, um, you know, put his mark on the World Cup and it was an incredible innings to watch, an incredible game. So hopefully theres a few more of those, Marsh said.</p>"

There are so many things involved in hosting a FIFA event--there are technical conducts, event management, one has to take care of protocols ranging from security to accreditations and power back-ups and so many things. But we have managed to do it successfully.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tFor the U-17 World Cup, we had the main stadium and another five training sites which were developed, including the main pitch of the Kalinga Stadium, all according to FIFA standards, Krishna informed.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver Rs 70 crores were spent for preparing the infrastructure for the World Cup.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tIt included five football pitches  the main stadium and four practice pitches (Police Battalion Ground 1, Ground 2, the Capital High School Ground and another artificial turf in Unit 1).</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd not that everything went off smoothly, there were unexpected hitches and challenges but that didnt deter Krishna and his staff.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tDuring the pandemic, as the nation came to a standstill, the progress of work for the U-17 World Cup got badly hit.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDuring the Covid-19 time, we were supposed to construct one artificial turf and that got delayed for obvious reasons. The import of some of the grass pitches also became an issue because of shipping problems.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore the start of the World Cup there was a rainy season and it was followed by the festival season. We had to adjust with all these things, yet could hold it successfully, Krishna said.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe reason behind Odishas success, Krishna pointed out, is that the state government worked in close coordination with all National Sports Federations (NSFs).</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe extend them whatever support the federations need so that all events are hosted successfully, Krishna said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe senior IAS officer said hosting the U-17 World Cup efficiently wasnt a one-off event for the state government.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will continue to support football in future. Not to forget the fact that in Odisha, we had earlier hosted the Super Cup, which was played by the top club in the country.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tIn Odisha, the IWL (Indian Womens League) was played, while the age group SAFF tournament was organised here as well.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Odisha FC, which play in the ISL (Indian Super League) is here with us. The states womens football team has been doing well, only recently they finished runners-up in the National Games in Gujarat.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe had strongly been associated with football before and there is no change in our policy. We remain committed to the development of football, said the Secretary of Sports for Odisha.</p>"

Ganguly had played an active role in appointing Laxman to the NCA post as well. </p><p><h2>Record IPL media rights </h2></p><p>The IPL media rights for the period of 2023-2027 were sold at a huge amount of Rs. 48,390 crore, which is the second highest for any sporting event after the United States' National Football League. </p><p>Also, the monopoly of a company in acquiring media rights across platforms was broken with two separate biddings for television and digital media. </p><p>While Star won the television rights for Rs. 23,575 crore, Viacom 18 bagged the digital rights at a bigger amount of Rs. 23,758 crore. </p><p><h2>Women's IPL</h2></p><p>Barely a few weeks ago, the outgoing BCCI president had announced the commencement of the women's IPL, which is likely to begin next year. </p><p>In a letter to the state associations, Ganguly wrote as quoted by various media, 'The BCCI is currently working on the much-awaited Women’s IPL. We are expecting to start the first season early next year.' </p><p><h2>Controversies</h2></p><p>Captaincy issues involving Virat Kohli </p><p>Ganguly's decisions on former skipper Virat Kohli (his stepping down as T20 captain and each other's contradictory remarks on the issue) also earned him the wrath of many in cricketing circles and among Kohli fans. </p><p>Ganguly claimed he had personally requested Kohli not to step down as the T20 skipper, something which the latter contradicted. </p><p><h2>Wriddhiman Saha's allegation</h2></p><p>After getting dropped from the senior men's team, wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha made an explosive claim that Ganguly had assured him of a berth in Team India as long as he remains the BCCI boss. </p><p>The claim had raised questions on whether Ganguly interferes into the team selection, which primarily remains the job of the selection committee. </p><p><h2>Endorsements</h2></p><p>Reports said former BCCI president and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) owner N Srinivasan was one among those who slammed Sourav Ganguly as a board president accusing him of 'nonperformance' and alleging that he had represented brands that were the direct rivals of sponsors of BCCI. </p><p>Ganguly, a common face for multiple brands catering to diverse products, was also slammed by his ex-colleague and Delhi BJP MP Gautam Gambhir for doing surrogate advertising. </p><p><b>’If the BCCI president (Ganguly) is doing it (endorsing fantasy league), you can't expect other players not to do it,’ said Gambhir, who made his international debut under Ganguly's captaincy.</b></p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\t<strong>Q. What is the biggest takeaway from the film&#39;s success both critically and commercially?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Satyam:</strong> I feel good that a discourse based on the film is created. The film has been able to create a situation where people are discussing it. From that perspective, I feel the film is critically successful. It is rare to have a Bengali film that triggers a discussion. Moreover, we are happy that the production has been received with open hands by so many people since a film, of course, has a commercial responsibility.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/5fab114ba9a4f9b708ae2a9fb60d0ec51.jpeg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Surangana:</strong> I think the biggest takeaway from this film&#39;s success is the fact that honesty and hard work always pay off because this film was made with genuine effort. The director, screenplay writer wanted to tell the story and wanted it to reach the audience on a larger scale. They did it with a lot of honesty and genuinity.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q.Being self-critics, did you find any area which you felt could have been better?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Satyam:</strong> Being a very ardent self-critic, I found a lot of places where I could have been better in terms of timing, delivery and body movement. I feel an actor must not be content with his work otherwise his/her acting self will receive a blow.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Surangana:</strong> I think any artist will find areas where he/she can be better. I find a lot of flaws whenever I watch my performances. I think that is how we retain our sense as an artist because the moment I stop doing that and become satisfied with my own work, I will probably stop being an actor. So till the time I find flaws in my performance and scope to learn and correct them, I will keep on being an actor.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/5fab114ba9a4f9b708ae2a9fb60d0ec5.jpeg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q. How difficult is it to self analyse a film or a performance which is widely accepted?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Satyam:</strong> It is not possible for me to analyse the film as a whole because I am emotionally connected to it. Maybe I can judge my own performance but not the entire work. I consider the reactions of the critics and audience as the ultimate truth.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Surangana:</strong> I think it&#39;s not the matter of being widely accepted. I think I can still criticise a piece of work even if it&#39;s widely accepted. As an audience I think it is easier to do. When I&#39;m a part of something, it becomes a little more difficult because I know what (problems and compulsions) has gone on to make a scene. But I think an artist&#39;s job is to remain objective and analyse any work of art.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q. What were Anirban Bhattacharya&#39;s first words to you both after the release?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Surangana:</strong> Anirban-da didn&#39;t really get the time to speak much or say something because he has been overstressed and working non-stop on the film. The most rewarding thing was to see him finally smile and enjoy the fact that the cinema halls are full of viewers and his work has been appreciated. It was great to finally see him out of stress and finally enjoy the love, which I think he deserves.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/5fab114ba9a4f9b708ae2a9fb60d0ec51.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\tJust before the film&#39;s release, he texted everyone in the team with a voice note along with a write up which helped us to calm down amid our nervousness.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Satyam:</strong> The voice note was very personal and emotional. I want to keep it with myself and don&#39;t want to share it with anyone else.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q. Being theatre artists, you receive the audience&#39;s reaction in real time. Did hall visits give you the same feeling?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Surangana: </strong>Not exactly. The audience&#39;s reaction in theatres and cinema halls are very different. But in the hall visits, we definitely got a lot of love from the audience. Moreover it was great to see people laughing because during shooting we were unaware of how the audience was going to react. So finally seeing the audience&#39;s reaction was very rewarding.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Satyam: </strong>I felt the reaction during the hall visits was remotely similar to that of the theatres. Unlike theatres, only a few actors from the film were present during the hall visits. The kind of love and affection we got from the audience is kind of similar to what I felt in the theatres.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/5fab114ba9a4f9b708ae2a9fb60d0ec52.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q. What does the film&#39;s success mean to you professionally?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Satyam: </strong>The film&#39;s success is a ray of hope that we will get more opportunities of work. We can&#39;t expect anything more than being a professional. I hope to continue with work and be among people.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Surangana:</strong>&nbsp;The film&#39;s success means a lot to me personally, because I&#39;ve learnt a lot, and had some beautiful experiences being a part of this film. But, what the film&#39;s success means to me professionally is not something I can predict.</p>\n<p>\n\tI just hoped to convincingly portray the character that had been given to me and the fact that people have appreciated that and most importantly Anirban da and my entire team is satisfied with my work gives me a lot of encouragement to try and better myself constantly.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(Images by Avishek Mitra/IBNS)</strong></p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tA film poster is an identity card that introduces you to the makers of the film and the subject. They are not only an advertisement and promotional strategy but also to familiarise the viewer with the aesthetics of the filmmaker and serve as a tiny trailer for the film. Film posters offer readings that sometimes reach beyond the film. They throw up the &lsquo;first look&rsquo; before a film&rsquo;s release. They also carry stories of ego-fights among actors about whose name should be at the top in the credits on the posters. Posters are visual documentation of films that could become a part of the cinema archive of a country.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs an eleven year old boy hung up on Amitabh Bachchan, SMM Ausaja who lived in Lucknow eventually became a collector of big B&rsquo;s films. &ldquo;One day, Mr. Tandon of Novelty theatre, Lucknow, gifted me with a poster of Tinnu Anand&rsquo;s Kaalia starring Amitabh Bachchan. It was a dream-come-true for me being a hard core fan of this great star. I had no clue what to do with it except gawking at it all the time,&rdquo; says Ausaja. He had no clue then that many years later, he would be writing and editing a book on posters of Mr. Bachchan&rsquo;s films.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/cf6782d42be26a5f1b7fb23d633a9b5e1.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Ausaja is counted among the biggest collectors of film posters in the country today. Over time, his passion shifted focus from Mr. Bachchan to posters and collectibles per se, all on and around Hindi films.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;When India&rsquo;s first film, Raja Harishchandra was released in Mumbai&rsquo;s Coronation Cinema more than 100 years ago, the announcements appeared in the Times of India. For the release of India&rsquo;s first sound film Alam Ara (1931), posters were unknown. The screening was advertised through text-based handbills and advertisements in newspapers and this was the norm. The earliest surviving poster of an Indian film is believed to have been before Alam Ara. It was a 1924 film called Kalyan Khajina directed by Baburao Painter,&rdquo; Ausaja informs.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Posters hold&nbsp; prime place in my collection. Later, I expanded to include lobby cards, hand-designed show cards, film journals, hand bills, LP Vinyl records, Postcards, Black &amp; white/colour stills, glass slides and booklets. Over time, I realised that there is a world beyond Bachchan in 1996 when I came to Mumbai. My perspective had broadened. Stocks of film memorabilia are depleting every passing day and there are few sources of authentic collectibles. I began collecting memorabilia focussed on famous films and film stars broadening the range.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tHe has parted with some of his posters and memorabilia with OSIANS, founded and managed by Neville Tuli, but &ldquo;only the ones I have several copies of&rdquo; adding, &ldquo;OSIANS has a wonderful vision of providing a platform for people searching for South Asian Art and Culture. OSIANS is the largest non-political entity that is genuinely archiving and documenting Indian cinema. I joined it to compliment his vision. It is the only auction house in the country that caters to Indian cinema-based auctions. Such auctions help generate both value and interest towards film memorabilia. People who invest realise that this can be a good investment option.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/cf6782d42be26a5f1b7fb23d633a9b5e2.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The biggest hazard Ausaja faces is preservation and storage. He says: &ldquo;I have lost precious, hand-painted Bobby show cards in the heavy downpours in Mumbai. I also lost a precious Prabhat Film Company lobby card of a silent film. I have rented a godown with four rooms where I store the memorabilia.&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&quot;The most difficult part is to preserve and restore old decaying posters. It is very expensive too. I store the posters in rolls of 50 each and rarely open these rolls. The wear-and-tear is inevitable as these posters were usually printed on the cheapest paper available,&rdquo; he explains.</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier, posters of films were first hand-painted by artists who copied from Black &amp; White stills from a given film and then painted by choosing the ones they felt would fit into the story, theme and the cast. Lithography was the sole technique for printing posters. Big budget film producers would order several posters for the same film to attract movie buffs. In a digitalized world where posters can be designed simply with a software programme with a few clicks, these posters have carved a history of their own.</p>\n<p>\n\t​<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/cf6782d42be26a5f1b7fb23d633a9b5e3.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\tThousands of lithographic posters were printed on cheap, thin paper and posted on billboards and walls. This lithographic printing process is still in use by commercial printers across the world. But in India the value of these film posters not known and were discarded as rubbish. It was left to the imagination of archivists like Ausaja of Mumbai, Navin Anand&rsquo;s shop in Delhi&rsquo;s Karol Bagh Market, the Osians, collector Haji Abu&rsquo;s poster shop in Chor Bazaar, Mumbai, Film Heritage Foundation and Kolkata&rsquo;s Rohit Mukherjee and Sudipta Chanda, to bring them into focus.</p>\n<p>\n\tAusaja believes that digitization of vintage art works and prints are good for preservation and posterity. &ldquo;The visuals are saved from destruction. But preserving originals is a difficult and expensive process that costs anything between Rs 4,000 and Rs.80, 000 per poster. Hand-designed film posters were printed on Litho press till the 1980s and then offset press took over. Digital designing began in the 1990s and the art of hand designs and paintings faded completely.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The new posters have a brilliant body but somehow it feels that the soul is missing. It&rsquo;s like having a fast-food lunch over a la carte at a plush hotel,&rdquo; Ausaja laments and also points out that digitization of posters has taken away the livelihood of the original poster painters.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Earlier, posters were manually painted by artists who made a living out of painting posters. M.F. Hussain began his long and illustrious career as a painter of film posters. I have had the good fortune to meet Pandit Ram Kumar Sharma during a project titled 1857 in which I was working with Sanjay Khan.</p>\n<p>\n\t​<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/cf6782d42be26a5f1b7fb23d633a9b5e4.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;I had no clue then that this grand old man was a master poster designer as he was introduced as a &lsquo;supervising art director on aesthetics&rsquo; for the era being shot for a TV series! He passed away a few years later but I cherish the memory of that meeting. I have known Srikant Dhongade, a brilliant designer who was a fine art expert himself. My regret is that I could never meet Diwakar Karkare, one of my favourites,&rdquo; he says.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe biggest tragedy for a collector like SMM Ausaja is that &ldquo;as collectors, we have absolutely no copyright over any image of poster that we stock.&quot; &quot;It is purely a labour of love, a passion for cinema as an influential and impressionable medium of art and culture. At the same time, we remain important sources of authentic information for posterity. The copyrights rest with the world right holders of the film,&rdquo; he sums up.&nbsp; His book Bollywood in Posters is a collector&rsquo;s item.</p>"

Was it an instant &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to Anirban Bhattacharya?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A.</strong> Anirban knows my acting skills and that&#39;s why he thought I can do justice to this character. So he offered me this role and I couldn&#39;t find any reason to say &#39;No&#39;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q. Did you feel an extra comfort since both of you (Debraj and Anirban) as well as other cast members were from the theatre background?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A.</strong> Yes, I feel comfortable working with him. I guess any other actor also feels the same because his concept regarding work is very clear and prosecution is simple and easy and before starting any project, he does his homework very sincerely.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd most importantly, we are not just co-actors, we are also friends. So working with him is always wonderful.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/baba46601de36bcdefcef467fcd0df491.jpeg' alt='Debraj Bhattacharya | Image Credit: SVF' class='article-image'/><span class='photo-courtsey'>Debraj Bhattacharya | Image Credit: SVF</span></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q.

And the songs had been ready before the shoot started. So actor Debraj didn&#39;t have any clash or conflict with singer Debraj.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q. How many hectic conversations went on between you and Anirban on the music front?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A.</strong> Nothing was hectic in this movie except the shooting schedule.. we got sufficient time for composing the music.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q. What&rsquo;s your biggest takeaway from this film?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A.</strong> Playing one of my favourite characters from Badal Sircar&#39;s plays and the way the audience accepted it is the biggest reward for me in this project. Yes, the audience&#39;s reaction is the most precious reward for an actor.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>(Image Credit: SVF)</strong></p>"

The transaction got canceled, and the person was charged.</p>\n<p>\n\tSouth Korean police briefed local media on the case involving the online post made on an online marketplace selling JK&rsquo;s lost hat at 10 million Korean Won.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe case attracted massive attention from the public as the seller claimed to be an employee at the foreign affairs ministry and to have acquired it from the office premises.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>On November 7, the Seocho Police Station in Seoul announced that they had completed the investigation on the former employee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who made an online post to sell the hat worn by Jungkook.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tPreviously, the person attempted to trying to sell the hat worn by Jungkook for 10 million won (approximately $7,100), posting a photo of the hat online together with a picture of a civil service employee identification card.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe person claimed that Jungkook left the hat in the waiting area when BTS visited the Passport Division to make their passports and that they acquired ownership of the hat since no one called or visited to claim ownership for six months after it was reported as lost property, soompi.com reported.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>However, it was revealed that there was no record of the hat being reported as a lost item from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the National Police Agency.

        "content": "<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><strong>You have often said that Delhi Crime (1) was a turning point in your career in recent times.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tRight. Not only for me as an actor, but for the entire team as it has been able to redefine the role of the woman as a protagonist who doesn&rsquo;t necessarily belong to the 18 -22 age-group ready to romance, sing, dance and the rest. For me, it has been a wonderful learning experience. I&rsquo;ve never been chasing leading lady roles and they never came to me when I was ready for those roles. But today, everything has changed, including the audience that has gone crazy after Delhi Crime which led the producers to go for the second season.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>In Delhi Crime Season 2, how did you work on the character of Vartika, perhaps one of the most challenging roles of your career?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tFor the first series, I constantly discussed with the original woman police officer who handled the Nirbhaya case. It helped that director Richie Mehta made it clear from the start that he wanted &ldquo;not just an actor, but a collaborator.&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know any other way of doing a show besides being completely consumed by it and the character. I remember when we attended the 2019 Sundance Film Festival where the show premiered, I heard a couple of people asking the organizers, &lsquo;Is she the real cop who cracked the case?&rsquo; I felt that was a win.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>Do you find major differences between the Vartika Chaturvedi of Season 1 of DC and the Vartika Chaturvedi of Season 2?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tI personally believe that it&rsquo;s unfair to compare the two seasons. Having said that, I&rsquo;d like to state that Vartika Chaturvedi is no longer the person she was in Season 1 where she had become a larger-than-life figure but in Season 2, she is more human. She has changed and one might say that this change is the natural process of growth for any woman in her position. Besides, in Season 1, the stress was different. It was focused on the crime which the team was bent on solving and catching the culprits and making them pay for their heinous crime. This time, it is the other way round. A crime has been committed and the team goes to solve it. The dedication is there, the responsibility is the same but the approach is different. Season 2 throws up how differences exist among us on the basis of class, caste, sex, age and why which was not the case in Season 1. And this has a deep impact on Vartika&rsquo;s character and work.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>You are being showered with awards for your performances. Does it create any special pressure on you to give your best?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tMy work is not award-prone at all. I work on the character and take the guidance of the director about the character. Of course, awards make one happy but it doesn&rsquo;t affect my work in any way. For instance, I get the jitters even today, after around 25 years in the industry, when the camera is about to roll. I feel I&rsquo;d forget my lines and make a hash of everything. But this works very positively in my case to give of my best. I am passionate about my work and no one can stop me from being passionate.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/9620fd41376bed09629b7d87cd61e55f1.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>To enact Gauri in Human, where you play a negative character, how did you approach the role?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tI was thrilled about Gauri, I truly was. She is so omnipresent in the film. Gauri is one bundle of confusion and also, clear thinking, of stating that poor people&rsquo;s lives do not matter though she herself comes from a poverty-stricken background, of brazenly stating how she murdered her foster father and took over his hospital and his practice in cold blood. She has no issues with her husband having a mistress just as she doesn&rsquo;t bat an eyelid while sleeping with the minister or offering bribes to the CM if circumstances needed.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>Did you feel uncomfortable in the scenes with Kirti Kulhari in Human while doing the kissing scene?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tGauri isn&rsquo;t a lesbian but bisexual. And though I am not a lesbian in personal life, I accept these sexual orientations with an open mind. Since I am an actor, I simply had to take it in my stride. Kirti&rsquo;s approach and performance helped me a lot. She is no pure lily either as Saira in the series. Kirti is in full command of a character built purely on a string of lies she lives on, though she realises it very late, that the world she has created for herself is fake. It was a very enjoyable experience for me.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>You&rsquo;ve played a doctor both in Human and in Dr.G released recently. What are your comments on these roles?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tThough both the women are doctors, the environments they live in are completely different. In Human, Gauri is the protagonist and a powerful one at that. In Dr. G., I am not the protagonist and I play almost a cameo. I found both of them to be challenging and loved doing both.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>You have a different kind of role in Darlings, a film on wife abuse narrated with a heavy dose of black humour as the mother of Alia Bhatt. How do you look back on the film?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tThe mother-daughter relationship runs as a delightfully entertaining and spicy sub-plot which sometimes merges with the main husband-wife plot with amusing scenes in the police station where the mother-daughter duo come to complain and Hamza (the husband) suddenly comes in, throwing menacing looks at this &lsquo;new&rsquo; wife. The mother herself has been deserted by her husband and runs a food home delivery business so she knows exactly what is going wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\t<img src='https://www.indiablooms.com/showbiz_pic/2022/9620fd41376bed09629b7d87cd61e55f2.jpg' alt='' class='article-image'/></p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>You make wonderful use of silence in your emotive scenes.</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tAs an actor, I always feel that cinema, or television or OTT for that matter, is mainly a visual medium. So, why not focus more on the visual aspect of acting and do what one needs to do through silence? I find it often speaks better and more than words do.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:20px;\"><span style=\"font-family:georgia,serif;\"><strong>You&rsquo;ve opened your restaurant Jalsa in Ahmedabad and later in Bengaluru. What led to it?</strong></span></span></p>\n<p>\n\tI love cooking. I love serving, feeding people, hosting, and interiors. I am an excellent housewife even if I say so myself. And Jalsa became a package of all of it. I am also an artist and did much of the d&eacute;cor myself. After Covid, one of the biggest realisations was to celebrate each moment with the people we love because the quarantined really hit home. Jalsa is a perfect place that offers an entire experience of food, fun, music, dance, and togetherness. It serves authentic vegetarian dhaba-like fare and it is doing well.</p>"

So, if the filmmakers make films rooted in the region&#39;s culture, it may work,&quot; he said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tExplaining the mantra of more regional is more universal, Shetty said the more the filmmakers are connected to their cultural roots, more are the chances of films becoming successful.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;This is something Bollywood is forgetting these days,&quot; he said.</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tSome 16.6 million people - more than half the population -- now find themselves without regular access to enough safe and nutritious food.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt&#39;s a shocking reversal for Peru, an upper middle-income country according to the World Bank, that can grow all the food it needs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to a 2021 FAO study, 51 per cent of the population is living in moderate food insecurity. &ldquo;20 per cent of that group is in acute food insecurity&rdquo;, explains Fernando Castro Verastegui, Project coordinator at FAO Peru. &ldquo;That means people have reduced the quality of their diet or are eating less than they need.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tPoor alternatives</p>\n<p>\n\tPoverty is to blame, says the agency. The poverty rate this year is 25 per cent, meaning one in four Peruvians doesn&rsquo;t have enough money to cover their basic food basket.</p>\n<p>\n\tMost people end up simply alleviating their hunger, but not eating adequate food with all the necessary nutrients, such as proteins. In parts of the Peruvian Amazon rainforest - known locally as the &ldquo;Selva&rdquo; region - up to 70 per cent of the population is anaemic.</p>\n<p>\n\tRecipe for resilience</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the poor and dusty suburb of Chorrillos, one of Lima&rsquo;s shanty towns overlooking the Pacific Ocean, women are busy behind the stove.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmong them, Jenny Rojas Chumbe, a community activist, president of the soup kitchen &ldquo;Ayuda Social&rdquo; (or &ldquo;social support&rdquo;).</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen COVID-19 hit the country, sending millions home with no income, Jenny saw up close the urgent needs in her community and started collecting food to organize soup kitchens.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese &ldquo;ollas comunes&rdquo; - as they are known locally &ndash; receive donations from food banks as well as other organizations and individuals. From 220 daily meals at the peak of the pandemic, she is still serving about 100 a day today, even though many have gone back to work.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The number of meals we were giving had dropped to 50 a day, because the neighbours were doing better in terms of purchasing power. But lately, it&rsquo;s been rising, because the crisis is affecting a lot of people. If you take the vegetables, they are far too expensive. A kilogramme of potatoes costs more than three Soles ($0.80), a litre of cooking oil, more than 12 Soles ($3.15),&rdquo; Jenny explains.</p>\n<p>\n\tPrice spike</p>\n<p>\n\tSoaring potato prices have a real impact - and a powerful symbolic one in Peru:&nbsp; it is on the shores of Lake Titicaca, that potatoes were first cultivated.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for meat, chicken is the main source of protein in Peru, but only for those who can afford it. As a matter of fact, Jenny only cooks chicken for her neighbours, &ldquo;once, or twice a week, because it would be out of our budget&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tPeru&#39;s annual inflation rate for 2022 remains above eight per cent in the past months, its highest level in 24 years. Staples like wheat, rice, and cooking oil have more than doubled in price.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe soup kitchens were the people&rsquo;s response to the food problem that had been going on since before COVID, explains Fernando Castro Verastegui. &ldquo;We had rates of, for example, malnutrition and anaemia that had stagnated. The economic, political, and environmental problems that we were already having were telling us that the food situation was at risk. When COVID came, this exploded.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tCoronavirus effect</p>\n<p>\n\tPeru was indeed hit badly by COVID-19. It suffered the world&rsquo;s highest mortality rate during the pandemic, as more than 0.65 percent of the population succumbed to the virus. In parallel, lockdowns increased unemployment.</p>\n<p>\n\tWeight of inflation</p>\n<p>\n\tAdded to the post-COVID downturn, inflation, driven by the war in Ukraine, weighs heavily on prospects for recovery. Peru is also experiencing the increase in prices, says Castro, as a result of a series of phenomena that are taking place at a global level, especially the increase in fuel prices and supplies, also as a result of the conflicts in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn addition to the price hikes of food and energy, FAO points out that government mismanagement, poor dietary habits, and an over-reliance on imported food staples and fertilizers are additional causes of Peru&#39;s food crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\tImported chemical fertilizers cost up to four times what they did a year ago, forcing farmers to reduce their use. The fear is that this will likely impact food production in the coming months and aggravate existing vulnerabilities in Peru.</p>",

        "content": "<p>\n\tYanjun Xu, 42, was sentenced to 20 years in prison. According to court documents, Xu targeted American aviation companies, recruited employees to travel to China, and solicited their proprietary information, all on behalf of the government of the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC), reports US Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;As proven at trial, the defendant, a Chinese government intelligence officer, used a range of techniques to attempt to steal technology and proprietary information from companies based in both the U.S. and abroad,&rdquo; said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s sentence demonstrates the seriousness of those crimes and the Justice Department&rsquo;s determination to investigate and prosecute efforts by the Chinese government, or any foreign power, to threaten our economic and national security.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This case sends a clear message: we will hold accountable anyone attempting to steal American trade secrets,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Kenneth L. Parker for the Southern District of Ohio. &ldquo;Xu conspired to steal American science and technology. Thanks to the diligent work of the FBI, GE Aviation and our trial team, he&rsquo;ll spend decades in federal prison.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This case is just the latest example of the Chinese government&rsquo;s continued attacks on American economic security &ndash; and, by extension, our national security,&rdquo; said FBI Director Christopher Wray. &ldquo;The Chinese government tasked an officer of its spy service to steal U.S. trade secrets so it could advance its own commercial and military aviation efforts, at the expense of an American company. This brazen action shows that the Chinese government will stop at nothing to put our companies out of business to the detriment of U.S. workers. As long as the Chinese government continues to break our laws and threaten American industry and institutions, the FBI will work with its partners across the globe to bring those responsible to justice.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Nov. 5, 2021, a federal jury in Cincinnati convicted Xu on all counts: conspiracy to commit economic espionage, conspiracy to commit trade secret theft, attempted economic espionage and attempted trade secret theft.</p>\n<p>\n\tXu was a career intelligence officer, beginning in 2003 and rising to the rank of deputy division director at the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS), the intelligence and security agency for China.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to court documents and trial testimony, beginning in at least December 2013, Xu targeted specific companies in the United States and abroad that are recognized as leaders in the field of aviation.</p>\n<p>\n\tXu used aliases, front companies and universities to deceive aviation employees and solicit information. He identified individuals who worked for the companies and recruited them to travel to China, often initially under the guise that they were traveling to give a presentation at a university. Xu and others paid the individuals stipends on top of covering travel costs.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe scheme was executed with full coordination between the MSS and China&rsquo;s aviation entities. Xu worked with others in the MSS to hack or copy computers in hotel rooms while the aviation employees &ndash; his &ldquo;guests&rdquo; &ndash; were taken to dinner by the MSS.</p>\n<p>\n\tXu also openly talked about efforts to obtain U.S. military information in addition to commercial aviation trade secrets.</p>\n<p>\n\tAttempted GE Aviation trade secret theft</p>\n<p>\n\tXu attempted to steal technology related to GE Aviation&rsquo;s exclusive composite aircraft engine fan module &ndash; which no other company in the world has been able to duplicate &ndash; to benefit the Chinese state.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn March 2017, a GE Aviation employee in Cincinnati was solicited to give a report at a university in China. The employee traveled to China two months later to present at the university and was introduced to Xu. Xu and others paid the employee&rsquo;s travel expenses and a stipend.</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter the trip to China, the FBI took over communications with Xu, posing as the employee.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn January 2018, Xu requested &ldquo;system specification, design process&rdquo; information from the employee and &ndash; with the cooperation of GE Aviation, who was working with the FBI &ndash; the employee emailed a two-page document from the company that included a label that warned about the disclosure of proprietary information.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn February 2018, Xu began discussing with the employee the possibility of meeting in Europe during one of the employee&rsquo;s business trips and asked the employee to send a copy of the file directory for his company-issued computer.</p>\n<p>\n\tXu traveled to Belgium with cash and pictures of the employee on April 1, 2018. He was scheduled to meet with the employee and was arrested at that time.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Department of Justice&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs secured Xu&rsquo;s extradition to the United States, with valuable assistance provided by the government of Belgium, as well as the Belgian Federal Police.</p>\n<p>\n\tHandling of MSS spy in Chicago</p>\n<p>\n\tIn September 2022, a federal jury in Chicago convicted an individual (Ji Chaoqun) for working on behalf of the MSS under the direction of Xu.</p>\n<p>\n\tXu served as Ji&rsquo;s MSS handler while Ji, a Chinese citizen, lived and studied in Chicago. Xu officially registered Ji as a formal MSS overseas agent in January 2014 and directed Ji to collect biographical information on people to potentially recruit to work with them.</p>\n<p>\n\tXu provided Ji with the names of at least nine individuals in America to attempt to recruit. Ji obtained and provided Xu with more detailed background reports on the individuals. Ji also received training on how to speak to the FBI if approached at his school.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn May 2016, Ji joined the U.S. Army through a program that allowed legal aliens with vital skills like Chinese fluency. Ji told Xu and the MSS that he had successfully infiltrated the U.S. military as an MSS officer. His plan was to obtain citizenship quickly and obtain a top-secret security clearance.</p>\n<p>\n\tJi reported to an undercover FBI agent that he had access to all military bases with his military ID and volunteered, without prompting, to take pictures of aircraft carriers for the MSS.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe crimes committed by Ji were done on behalf of the MSS, through Xu Yanjun.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Xu&rsquo;s handling and placement of a spy within the United States to obtain information regarding aviation technology and employees is yet another facet of Xu&rsquo;s egregious crimes towards the United States and further justifies the significant sentence of imprisonment he received today,&rdquo; said U.S. Attorney Parker.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe MSS hacking of a French aerospace manufacturer</p>\n<p>\n\tThe evidence at trial showed Xu recruited insiders within a French aircraft engine manufacturer&rsquo;s facility in China who were willing to spy on Xu&rsquo;s behalf. Xu and his assets targeted a French employee of the company that often traveled to the facility in China for work. In 2013, Xu directed one of his assets within the company to plant malware on the French employee&rsquo;s work computer, with the ultimate goal of being able to infiltrate the company&rsquo;s network in France. The evidence at trial also showed Xu&rsquo;s integral role in the installation of the malware, his instructions to destroy the malware, and Xu&rsquo;s monitoring of the success and cover-up of the operation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe FBI investigated the case. The Justice Department&rsquo;s Office of International Affairs and the U.S. Attorneys&rsquo; Offices for the Northern District of Illinois and the District of Arizona provided valuable assistance.</p>\n<p>\n\tAssistant U.S. Attorney Timothy S. Mangan and Deputy Criminal Chief Emily N. Glatfelter for the Southern District of Ohio and Trial Attorney Matthew J. McKenzie of the National Security Division&rsquo;s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section represented the United States in this case.</p>",

        "content": "<p>\n\t&ldquo;This insecurity is exacerbating an already disastrous humanitarian situation&rdquo;, said Martha Pobee, Assistant Secretary-General for Africa in the Departments of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs and Peace Operations, pointing out that women and children are the primary victims of violence and growing inequality.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Regionally led force</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile the Joint Force of the Group of Five (G5) &ndash; created in 2017 by the then Heads of State from Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger to counter terrorism in the region &ndash; remains an important component in responding to the insecurity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite challenges, including the withdrawal of Mali in May from the force, Ms. Pobee assured that the Joint Force continues to conduct military operations across the Central Sector in the tri-border area, the Western Sector at the border between Mali and Mauritania, and the Eastern Sector at the border between Chad and Niger.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tMoreover, it is considering a new concept of operations to address the evolving security and humanitarian situation and the withdrawal of Mali.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, she updated that the Executive Secretariat and G5 Sahel components continue to put gender policy into action and boost training for women leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn supporting the G5 Sahel, she said the UN was building regional capacity in improving criminal justice, border security management and the prevention of radicalization and violent extremism, as militant groups continue to expand across the region.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Maintaining support</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tShe informed the Council the UN Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) continues to bolster the Joint Force, including by working with contractors to deliver &ldquo;life support consumables to the four contingents of the Force outside of Mali&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Technical and operational challenges remain a matter of concern&rdquo;, said Ms. Pobee while noting that disagreement between the G5 Sahel Member States, which culminated in the withdrawal of Mali, has further complicated MINUSMA&rsquo;s ability to support the Joint Force.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A matter of rights</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN human rights office, OHCHR, also underpins the Joint Force in operationalizing its international human rights and humanitarian law compliance framework.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Defeating terrorism and violent extremism requires a comprehensive response and will not be attained through military gains only&rdquo;, she underscored.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;It is important that the Joint Force integrates human rights and international humanitarian law into the core of its operations, or risk fostering further breeding ground for violent extremist groups, causing ever increasing suffering for the populations&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tLikewise, counter-terrorism military strategies must be &ldquo;fully anchored in human rights&hellip;[with] the protection of all populations at their core&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;Coordinated breakthrough&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe senior UN official stressed the urgent need for &ldquo;a coordinated breakthrough in our response to violent extremism&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;If we fail in this effort, the effects of terrorism, violent extremism and organized crime will be felt far beyond the Sahel region and, indeed, the African continent&rdquo;, she stated, pushing for a &ldquo;rethink&rdquo; to approaches.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the coming months, political dialogue in the region is critical to pursue common security objectives, she said.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;Responsibility and solidarity&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tWhile &ldquo;deeply committed&rdquo; to supporting a resolution to the current regional tensions, Ms. Pobee said that &ldquo;only by working together, in a coordinated and complementary manner&rdquo;, can the multiple challenges ahead be effectively addressed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn that spirit, the UN, the African Union (AU) and others are supporting an Independent High-Level Panel on Security and Development in the Sahel, aimed &ldquo;to marshal greater attention and resources on the national, sub-regional, regional, and international level and propose innovative ways to address the security, governance and development challenges in the region&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile awaiting the Panel&rsquo;s recommendations, she said she was counting on the Council&rsquo;s continued support towards a &ldquo;stable, secure, peaceful and prosperous Sahel&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Faced with the growing threats to the region and beyond, we urge the international community to remain engaged in the spirit of shared responsibility and solidarity with the populations of the region&rdquo;, concluded the UN official.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Invited to speak</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tEric Tiar&eacute;, Executive Secretary of the G5 Sahel, stressed that despite discouragement, Member States should not give up.</p>\n<p>\n\tInstead, he highlighted the need to double down on ground-level support for the G5 force, while reminding that urgent action is required to stem terrorist expansion.</p>\n<p>\n\tZakaria Ousman Ramadan, Chair of the Chadian Centre for Strategic Studies and Prospective Research, maintained that the widening terrorist activity threatens national resources across the region.</p>",

This is an occasion to celebrate our diversity, recognize our common humanity, and marvel at advancements in health that have extended lifespans and dramatically reduced maternal and child mortality rates,&rdquo; said UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres. &ldquo;At the same time, it is a reminder of our shared responsibility to care for our planet and a moment to reflect on where we still fall short of our commitments to one another,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe global population is growing at its slowest rate since 1950, having fallen under 1 per cent in 2020. The latest projections by the United Nations suggest that the world&rsquo;s population could grow to around 8.5 billion in 2030 and 9.7 billion in 2050. It is projected to reach a peak of around 10.4 billion people during the 2080s and to remain at that level until 2100.</p>\n<p>\n\tWorld Population Prospects 2022 also states that fertility has fallen markedly in recent decades for many countries. Today, two-thirds of the global population lives in a country or area where lifetime fertility is below 2.1 births per woman, roughly the level required for zero growth in the long run for a population with low mortality. The populations of 61 countries or areas are projected to decrease by 1 per cent or more between 2022 and 2050, owing to sustained low levels of fertility and, in some cases, elevated rates of emigration.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore than half of the projected increase in the global population up to 2050 will be concentrated in eight countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania. Countries of sub-Saharan Africa are expected to contribute more than half of the increase anticipated through 2050.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The relationship between population growth and sustainable development is complex and multidimensional&rdquo; said Liu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs. &ldquo;Rapid population growth makes eradicating poverty, combatting hunger and malnutrition, and increasing the coverage of health and education systems more difficult.</p>\n<p>\n\tConversely, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, especially those related to health, education and gender equality, will contribute to reducing fertility levels and slowing global population growth.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn most countries of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, the share of population at working age (between 25 and 64 years) has been increasing thanks to recent reductions in fertility. This shift in the age distribution provides a time-bound opportunity for accelerated economic growth per capita, known as the &ldquo;demographic dividend&rdquo;. To maximize the potential benefits of a favourable age distribution, countries should invest in the further development of their human capital by ensuring access to health care and quality education at all ages and by promoting opportunities for productive employment and decent work.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe share of global population at ages 65 and above is projected to rise from 10 per cent in 2022 to 16 per cent in 2050. At that point, it is expected that the number of persons aged 65 years or over worldwide will be more than twice the number of children under age 5 and about the same as the number under age 12. Countries with ageing populations should take steps to adapt public programmes to the growing numbers of older persons, including by establishing universal health care and long-term care systems and by improving the sustainability of social security and pension systems.</p>\n<p>\n\tGlobal life expectancy at birth reached 72.8 years in 2019, an improvement of almost 9 years since 1990. Further reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average global longevity of around 77.2 years in 2050. Yet in 2021, life expectancy for the least developed countries lagged 7 years behind the global average.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected all three components of population change. Global life expectancy at birth fell to 71.0 years in 2021. In some countries, successive waves of the pandemic may have produced short-term reductions in numbers of pregnancies and births, while for many other countries, there is little evidence of an impact on fertility levels or trends. The pandemic severely restricted all forms of human mobility, including international migration.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Further actions by Governments aimed at reducing fertility would have little impact on the pace of population growth between now and mid-century, because of the youthful age structure of today&rsquo;s global population. Nevertheless, the cumulative effect of lower fertility, if maintained over several decades, could be a more substantial deceleration of global population growth in the second half of the century,&rdquo; added John Wilmoth, Director of the Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs.</p>\n<div>\n\t<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n\t\t<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n\t\t\t8⃣ billion hopes<br />\n\t\t\t8⃣ billion dreams<br />\n\t\t\t8⃣ billion possibilities<br />\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\tOur planet is now home to 8⃣ billion people.<br />\n\t\t\t<br />\n\t\t\tGet the facts from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UNFPA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@UNFPA</a>: <a href=\"https://t.co/BvhEYXITVP\">https://t.co/BvhEYXITVP</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/8BillionStrong?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#8BillionStrong</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/bHgJiB26TX\">pic.twitter.com/bHgJiB26TX</a></p>\n\t\t&mdash; UNFPA (@UNFPA) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UNFPA/status/1592427186560147462?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 15, 2022</a></blockquote>\n\t<script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n\t</script>\n</div>\n<p>\n\t&nbsp;</p>",

It is the best possible argument for the fastest possible transition to renewable energy,&rdquo; he said.  </p>\n<p>\n\tOn Saturday, the World Food Programme (WFP) announced that it plans to facilitate the donation of 260,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer by the Russian fertilizer company Uralchem-Uralkali to countries in most need in Africa.

Undermining public health kills and these are life-and-death issues.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Guterres is proposing a way forward based on a Global Digital Compact for an open, free, secure, and inclusive internet.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Compact calls for universal connectivity via a &ldquo;human-centred digital space&rdquo; where free speech and privacy are protected, and which promotes the safe and responsible use of data.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN chief has also called for a global code of conduct that promotes integrity in public communications as well as information literacy.</p>"

In the last reporting period&hellip;there&#39;s been 20 missions to six countries in which a variety of evidentiary material has been collected&rdquo;, said Mr. Khan.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said that partnerships have already begun paying dividends, detailing that last month, the Joint Investigative Team allowed the transfer of three individuals from Ethiopia to the domestic courts in Italy and the Netherlands.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This shows the consistency&hellip;[that] the International Criminal Court is not an apex court. It is a hub and we need to work together to make sure there is less space for impunity and greater efforts.

However, he also added that he was not willing to &quot;make any fundamental concessions&quot; about the US&#39; policy on Taiwan.</p>\n<p>\n\tBiden, unlike previous US presidents, has repeatedly said the US would defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut the White House has always rolled back his comments, insisting that Washington&#39;s stance of &quot;strategic ambiguity&quot; - under which it does not commit to defending Taiwan but also does not rule out the option - remains unchanged, the BBC said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe White House later said on Thursday that it would brief Taiwan on the results of the meeting, with national security adviser Jake Sullivan saying the aim was to make Taiwan feel &quot;secure and comfortable&quot; about US support.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, China&#39;s foreign ministry said the US should work together with China to avoid misunderstandings and misjudgements, adding that while it wants peace with the US, &quot;the Taiwan question&quot; is at the core of its interests.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the Chinese Communist Party congress in October, Xi reiterated China&#39;s position on Taiwan where they would &quot;never promise to renounce the use of force&quot;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>He said they reserved the option of &quot;taking all measures necessary&quot; if &quot;outside forces&quot; interfered with China&#39;s claims.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe US has long been walking a tightrope over Taiwan. A cornerstone of its relationship with Beijing is the One China policy, according to which Washington acknowledges only one Chinese government - in Beijing - and has no formal ties with Taiwan.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut it also maintains close relations with Taiwan and sells arms to it under the Taiwan Relations Act, which states that the US must provide the island with the means to defend itself, the report said.</p>\n<p>\n\t(With UNI inputs)</p>",

The population is expected to remain at that level until 2100.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Slowest growth rate since 1950s</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, the annual World Population Prospect report, released on Monday to coincide with World Population Day, also notes that the global population is growing at its slowest rate since 1950, having fallen to less that one per cent in 2020.</p>\n<p>\n\tFertility, the report declares, has fallen markedly in recent decades for many countries: today, two-thirds of the global population lives in a country or area where lifetime fertility is below 2.1 births per woman, roughly the level required for zero growth in the long run, for a population with low mortality.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 61 countries or areas, the population is expected to decrease by at least one per cent over the next three decades, as a result of sustained low levels of fertility and, in some cases, elevated rates of emigration.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe COVID-19 pandemic has had an effect on population change: global life expectancy at birth fell to 71 years in 2021 (down from 72.9 in 2019) and, in some countries, successive waves of the pandemic may have produced short-term reductions in numbers of pregnancies and births.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Further actions by Governments aimed at reducing fertility would have little impact on the pace of population growth between now and mid-century, because of the youthful age structure of today&rsquo;s global population,&rdquo; said John Wilmoth, Director of the Population Division of the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA).</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Nevertheless, the cumulative effect of lower fertility, if maintained over several decades, could be a more substantial deceleration of global population growth in the second half of the century&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Growth concentrated in eight countries</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tMore than half of the projected increase in the global population up to 2050 will be concentrated in eight countries: the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines and the United Republic of Tanzania.</p>\n<p>\n\tCountries of sub-Saharan Africa are expected to contribute more than half of the increase anticipated through 2050.<br />\n\tLiu Zhenmin, UN Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, warned that rapid population growth makes eradicating poverty, combatting hunger and malnutrition, and increasing the coverage of health and education systems more difficult.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe &lsquo;demographic dividend&rsquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn most countries of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in parts of Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean, recent reductions in fertility have led to a &ldquo;demographic dividend&rdquo;, with a rise in the share of the working age population (25 to 64 years), providing an opportunity for accelerated economic growth per capita.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe report argues that, to make the most of this opportunity, countries should invest in the further development of their human capital, by ensuring access to health care and quality education at all ages, and by promoting opportunities for productive employment and decent work.</p>\n<p>\n\tAchieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals, especially those related to health, education and gender equality, will contribute to reducing fertility levels and slowing global population growth.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>More older people, living longer</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tThe world should expect to see far more grey hairs by 2050: by then, it is expected that the number of persons aged 65 years or over worldwide will be more than twice the number of children under the age of five, &nbsp;and about the same as the number under age 12.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurther reductions in mortality are projected to result in an average global longevity of around 77.2 years in 2050. Yet in 2021, life expectancy for the least developed countries lagged seven years behind the global average.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe report recommends that countries with ageing populations should take steps to adapt public programmes to the growing numbers of older persons, establishing universal health care and long-term care systems, and by improving the sustainability of social security and pension systems.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s World Population Day falls during a milestone year, when we anticipate the birth of the Earth&rsquo;s eight billionth inhabitant&rdquo;, said UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, reacting to the report&rsquo;s findings.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is an occasion to celebrate our diversity, recognize our common humanity, and marvel at advancements in health that have extended lifespans and dramatically reduced maternal and child mortality rates,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;At the same time, it is a reminder of our shared responsibility to care for our planet and a moment to reflect on where we still fall short of our commitments to one another&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>World Population Day</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Let us protect human rights and the ability of all individuals to make informed choices about whether and when to have children,&rdquo; the UN chief said in his message marking World Population Day, coinciding with the report.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We still live in a world of vast gender inequality &ndash; and we are witnessing renewed assaults on women&rsquo;s rights, including on essential health services,&rdquo; said the Secretary-General.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe called the day &ldquo;an occasion to celebrate our diversity, recognize our common humanity, and marvel at advancements in health that have extended lifespans and dramatically reduced maternal and child mortality rates&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, Mr. Guterres described it as a reminder of &ldquo;our shared responsibility to care for our planet and a moment to reflect on where we still fall short of our commitments to one another&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmidst COVID-19, the climate crisis, wars and conflicts, humanitarian emergencies, hunger and poverty, he attested that &ldquo;our world is in peril&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Complications related to pregnancy and childbirth are still the leading cause of death among girls aged 15 to 19&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Guterres underscored that &ldquo;eight billion people means eight billion opportunities to live dignified and fulfilled lives&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe urged everyone to contribute to a common future with greater equality and solidarity for the planet and future generations.</p>\n<p>\n\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>Road to prosperity</strong></span></p>\n<p>\n\tWorld Population Day offers a moment to celebrate human progress, the World Population Fund (UNFPA) said in its message for the day.</p>\n<p>\n\tDespite global challenges, UNFPA upheld that we live in a world in which &quot;higher shares of people are educated and live healthier lives than at any previous point in history&quot;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;Societies that invest in their people, in their rights and choices, have proven time and again that this is the road to the prosperity and peace that everyone wants&mdash;and deserves&quot;.</p>",

This is frankly sickening and a stain on our society,&rdquo; he told the General Assembly recently.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Humiliation and stigmatization</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights was in New York to present his latest report, which focuses on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhen poor people talk about their lives, they mention things like their low incomes, or being unable to find decent work, said Mr. De Schutter, who spoke to UN News just prior to addressing Member States.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, other issues also surface in these conversations, he said, such as humiliation and exclusion, or being treated badly solely because of their socio-economic status, including when interacting with public and private institutions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tFor example, people applying for social benefits have reported being treated with suspicion and disdain. As a result, mountains of money are going unclaimed.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>More than income&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Being poor is not simply having insufficient income to buy the goods and services that allow you to lead a decent life. It is also being stigmatized. It is being looked down upon. It is being discriminated against in access to employment, housing, healthcare and education,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tHis report calls for banning &lsquo;povertyism&rsquo; &ndash; the word used to describe harmful attitudes and behaviours towards poor people.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;For many years we have recognized that racism, sexism, trans or homophobia, should be outlawed, should be prohibited in legislation, because they have no place in our world,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Well, the same should be said about povertyism, in terms of the negative treatment of people in poverty who are discriminated against simply because they live on low incomes, because they don&#39;t have the cultural codes, because they don&#39;t dress well, because they have the wrong accent.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Human rights focus</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe report argues that poverty will not be eradicated so long as povertyism persists, and Mr. De Schutter urged governments to review their anti-discrimination laws to better protect people.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Special Rapporteur also has recommended that authorities should abandon a &ldquo;charity&rdquo; approach to eradicating poverty and instead focus on one that upholds human rights and supports empowerment.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;As long as we remain in an approach to tackling poverty that is based on charity from the State, and as long as we don&#39;t recognize that States have duties towards people in poverty who themselves are rights holders, then we will fail to effectively address poverty,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Poverty should be seen as a violation of human rights, and people in poverty should have access to recourse mechanisms if they are excluded from housing, from education, from access to jobs on a nondiscriminatory basis, or indeed from social protection. And in many countries, this is difficult or even impossible to achieve.&quot;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Support social protection floors</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe international community can also do more to eliminate poverty and promote social justice by supporting low-income countries, home to some 711 million people.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt will cost around $79 billion annually for these nations to establish social protection programmes, according to estimates by the International Labour Organization (ILO).</p>\n<p>\n\tTo finance these schemes, Mr. De Schutter and the ILO propose the creation of a Global Fund for Social Protection.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Mobilize domestic resources</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tCountries that pledge to cover their citizens - &ldquo;from birth to death, from child allowances and maternity benefits to old age pension, and including unemployment benefits, sickness benefits and so on&rdquo; &ndash; should be able to access this support, he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tGovernments would also have to commit to mobilize domestic resources as well.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;And combined, international support and the mobilization of domestic resources should allow these countries to implement Sustainable Development Goal one: the eradication of poverty, one of the targets of which is&hellip;about the universalization of social protection floors.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;A unique opportunity&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAsked if the SDG will be achieved by the 2030 deadline, Mr. De Schutter admitted that &ldquo;there is little room for being optimistic&rdquo; in the face of the global food and energy crisis sparked by Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, estimates indicate that the number of people living in extreme poverty will rise by 95 million as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut these crises also represent &ldquo;a unique opportunity for countries to realize that there are many gaps in their social protection systems&rdquo;, according to the human rights expert.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Progress is possible</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHe was impressed that many countries have adopted social protection measures, expanded existing ones, or implemented new schemes since the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I believe this is an opportunity that can be seized if we provide the right funding, if we adopt a rights-based approach to social protection, providing people with entitlements they may claim, and ensuring that governments feel that they have duties towards people in poverty.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Yes, we can significantly reduce poverty, if not eradicate it by 2030, at least make significant progress towards this objective&rdquo;.</p>",

Poor sanitation and lack of safe water supplies have led to a so far uncontrolled cholera outbreak.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo date, 2,600 suspected cases of cholera have been reported, half of them children, and claimed dozens of lives.</p>\n<p>\n\tGang violence continues to expand across the capital and in other regions of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Dozens killed</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn just over a week in mid-October, more than 71 people were killed, a dozen women were raped, and hundreds of residents were forced to flee their homes, as a result of turf wars between rival gangs in Croix-des-Bouquets, one of the main communes of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, according to the Human Rights Service of the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH).</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Kidnappings and sexual violence by gang members are being used as weapons to inflict severe pain and instil fear among the population,&rdquo; the High Commissioner said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;There is a desperate need to tackle the root causes of inequality and violence, including that have crippled the country&rsquo;s development for decades.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe latest Security Council resolution 2653 (2022) passed last month, establishing a sanctions regime targeting individuals and entities engaging in or supporting criminal activity and violence &ndash; together with a targeted arms embargo - is an important step, said Mr. T&uuml;rk.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Violent response to protests&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHundreds of thousands of people have been demonstrating since late August to protest against Government policies, the rising cost of living and the increasing insecurity, noted the UN rights office, OHCHR, adding that according to information received, at least 54 people were killed during protests, most of which allegedly because of disproportionate use of force by police officers.</p>\n<p>\n\tPolitical violence has also been documented with the killing of prominent political leaders and journalists.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Police must respect the principles of precaution, necessity and proportionality at all times when using force,&rdquo; said Mr. T&uuml;rk. &ldquo;Prompt, thorough and effective investigations need to be established and those responsible for unnecessary or disproportionate use of force must be held accountable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Suspend forced returns: UNHCR&rsquo;s Grandi</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn the light of the crisis, the UN refugee agency on Thursday, called on States in the region and beyond, to suspend the forced return of Haitians to their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tGiven the current situation, &ldquo;I appeal to all States to stand in solidarity with Haiti and urge them not to return Haitians to a country that is extremely fragile,&rdquo; said High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi.</p>\n<p>\n\tHaitian women, children and men who are outside the country and returned to Haiti may face life-threatening security and health risks, and further displacement inside the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe forced removal of people to a place where they may face risk of persecution, torture or other serious or irreparable harm would amount to &ldquo;refoulement&rdquo;, which is explicitly prohibited under international refugee and human rights law, UNHCR said.</p>\n<p>\n\tInternational law also prohibits collective expulsions and arbitrary detention associated with it.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>ECOSOC advisory group &lsquo;deeply concerned&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti, which meets under the umbrella of the UN&rsquo;s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) also issued a statement calling on the international community to urgently support the country&rsquo;s efforts to provide lifesaving aid to those in need.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We are alarmed that the continuing blockade by armed gangs of roads, ports, and the main oil terminal, will lead to many preventable deaths because of lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation, basic health care and food&rdquo;, said the group of 21 concerned nations.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Pregnant women and their newborns are significantly at risk. Most poor households, already made vulnerable by inflation and low-paying jobs, continue to suffer disproportionately. Alarmingly, hunger has reached a catastrophic level in the capital&rsquo;s Cit&eacute; Soleil neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Group said it welcomed efforts by the Government, with support from the UN as well as other international, national, and local civil society, &ldquo;to address the humanitarian needs of the population and mount an effective cholera response based on the national authorities&rsquo; experience and expertise.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tMembers called for more solidarity with the Haitian people and support for the humanitarian and cholera response in Haiti, including by contributing to the 2022 Haiti Humanitarian Response Plan which has only received 36 per cent of its $373.2 million requirements.</p>",

create space for dialogue and political participation, reduce community violence; secure the delivery of basic services, encourage reconciliation; and promote equal access to justice.  </p>\n<p>\n\tBut quicker and more effective actions are required to address needs and grievances by &ldquo;strengthening a whole-of-society approach and increase investments that build trust, community engagement and cohesion&rdquo;, he asserted. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Women&rsquo;s place </strong></p>\n<p>\n\tNext, Mr. Guterres highlighted that women and youth leadership be bolstered in shaping the future of their countries.   </p>\n<p>\n\tHe acknowledged the &ldquo;pivotal&rdquo;

together with the African Union&rsquo;s 2020 Continental Framework for Youth, Peace and Security &ndash; are important and complementary tools to amplify these critical voices,&rdquo; he said. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Important links</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA more holistic and integrated approach to building resilience and sustaining peace was his third priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe top UN official emphasized that this must include &ldquo;tailored investments across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus&rdquo;. </p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, he turned to the lack of financing for prevention and peacebuilding activities, saying that &ldquo;the international community continues to underinvest in peace&rdquo;. </p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;It is time to walk the talk&rdquo;, stressed the UN chief, reminding that the General Assembly&rsquo;s Financing for Peacebuilding resolution reflects a commitment to find increased and more predictable and sustainable funding. </p>\n<p>\n\tHe credited the UN Peacebuilding Fund with providing $150 million to 25 countries in Africa last year, which made it a catalyst for larger contributions by other financial institutions. </p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;But needs far outpace resources&rdquo;, continued the senior official. &ldquo;Funding must be scaled up &ndash; and partnerships with international financial institutions even more strengthened&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Action across sectors</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tUN Assistant Secretary-General for Africa, Martha Ama Akyaa Pobee, highlighted the complementary work of peacekeepers, human rights and humanitarian officials, along with the need for stronger collective action.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe also observed the large burdens carried by women working in conflict zones, maintaining that peace operations embody the opportunity to promote gender equality.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;Step up&rsquo; together</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking as Chair of The Elders group, independent global leaders who work on tackling conflict and existential threats, Mary Robinson said the Council needed to demonstrate coherence, act in the collective interests of the whole UN, and work more closely with other parts of the Organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Now is the time for the Council to step up and speak with one voice&rdquo;, she said adding that &ldquo;only through sustained engagement to tackle the root causes of conflict and build just and sustainable peace&rdquo;

But we must also urgently increase efforts to adapt to the impacts that are already here and those to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe report emphasizes that adaptation, as well as mitigation, must be front and centre in the global response to the climate crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Impacts will intensify</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tUnder the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, countries pledged to limit global warming to 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial temperatures but are far off track.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Pakistan floods and other current impacts, such as the historic drought in the Horn of Africa, are occurring when global temperature rise is at only 1.1&deg;Celsius above pre-industrial levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tIn a companion report issued earlier this week, UNEP said Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) &ndash; governments&rsquo; own national plans to tackle climate change &ndash; point towards global warming of up to 2.6&deg;C by the end of the century.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, research from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that climate risks will intensify with each tenth of a degree.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Failure to protect</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tFor UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, the report makes clear that the world is failing to protect people from what he called the &ldquo;here-and-now impacts&rdquo; of climate change.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Adaptation needs in the developing world are set to skyrocket to as much as $340 billion a year by 2030. Yet adaptation support today stands at less than one-tenth of that amount,&rdquo; he said in a message marking the launch.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The most vulnerable people and communities are paying the price. This is unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe report found that progress on adaptation has been &ldquo;slow and spotty&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tEighty per cent of countries have at least one national adaptation planning instrument, while one-third of the 197 governments that are party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have incorporated quantified and time-bound targets on adaptation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Financing at issue</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, nearly 90 per cent of planning instruments studied display consideration for gender and disadvantaged groups, such as Indigenous peoples.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, financing for these plans remains the sticking point.&nbsp; Estimated adaptation costs are five to 10 times greater than international adaptation finance flows to developing countries, which reached 29 billion in 2020, a four per cent increase over the previous year.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2020, combined adaptation and mitigation finance flows fell at least $17 billion short of the $100 billion pledged annually to developing countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tUNEP said a significant scale-up is needed to meet the goal of doubling 2019 finance flows by 2025, as stressed in the outcome of the COP26 global climate conference, held last year in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Nations need to back the strong words in the Glasgow Climate Pact with strong action to increase adaptation investments and outcomes, starting at COP27,&rdquo; said Ms. Andersen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, although implementation of adaptation actions &ndash; mainly in agriculture, water, ecosystems and cross-cutting sectors &ndash; is increasing, it is not keeping up with climate impacts and could be outpaced by accelerating climate risks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;No time to lose&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tUnderlining the need for strong political will to increase investments and outcomes, the Secretary-General said that the adaptation gap must be addressed in four critical ways.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The world must step up and protect people and communities from the immediate and ever-growing risks of the climate emergency. We have no time to lose,&rdquo; he warned.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN chief called for dramatically increasing the quantity and quality of financing so that developed countries will achieve the target of doubling support for adaption to $40 billion annually by 2025.</p>\n<p>\n\t&lsquo;At COP27, they must present a credible roadmap with clear milestones on how this will be delivered - preferably as grants, not loans,&rdquo; said Mr. Guterres.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;They must also use their influence as government shareholders of multilateral development banks to prioritize adaptation, resilience and vulnerability.&nbsp; At least half of all climate finance should flow towards adaptation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;Unblock&rsquo; investment pipeline</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe world urgently needs a new business model for turning adaptation priorities into investable projects, he continued, pointing to the mismatch between what governments propose and what financiers consider as investible.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The investment pipeline is blocked; we must unblock it now. We need a global surge in adaptation investment to save millions of lives from climate carnage.&nbsp; It is high time for unprecedented coordination among recipient governments, development partners and other financiers,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tRelatedly, the Secretary-General has asked the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the NDC Partnership, and several climate funds to work with public and private financers to pilot a new Adaptation Pipeline Accelerator for targeted countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Early warning saves lives</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Guterres highlighted the need for &ldquo;far better climate risk data and information&rdquo;, his third point, which are crucial to protect lives and livelihoods in vulnerable countries and communities.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor his final point, the UN chief stressed the importance of delivering on his appeal for universal early warning systems within five years.&nbsp; He called for providing the financial and technical support required to implement an action plan that the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) will present at COP27.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile these priority areas demand unprecedented international cooperation and support, he also acknowledged that in many places, it is too late for adaptation.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, COP27 must provide a clear and time-bound roadmap on closing the finance gap for addressing loss and damage, an issue that he said will be &ldquo;a central litmus test for success&rdquo; in Egypt.</p>",

        "content": "<p>\n\tMr. Grandi expressed hope that these dimensions &ldquo;will be in clearer focus&rdquo; at the COP27 UN climate change conference, opening this weekend in Egypt, and at its successor conference in a year&rsquo;s time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe climate emergency is ravaging resources and creating tensions, including between communities, particularly in already fragile contexts where authorities do not have the means to support adaptation and resilience.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Fear of more fighting</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I fear that without more attention and much greater financing for prevention, adaptation, and development and governance support - tensions, frustrations, competition will grow and spark wider conflict, with deadly consequences &ndash; including displacement,&rdquo;&nbsp; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN refugee chief was in Somalia last week where he met emaciated women, men and children affected by conflict and the historic drought in the Horn of Africa.</p>\n<p>\n\tRefugees from the country have been pushed into drought-affected areas of neighbouring Kenya.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>More international support</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The confluence of climate change and conflict has created very protracted displacement: therefore, inclusion and where possible integration, both in refugee contexts and situations of internal displacement, are important peacebuilding measures requiring greater international recognition and support,&rdquo; Mr. Grandi told the Council.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis &ldquo;spiral&rdquo; is evident in several other hotspots, including Africa&rsquo;s Sahel region, he added.&nbsp; Three million people there have been uprooted by climate change, poverty, weak governance and armed group activities, as well as &ldquo;the often brutal reaction of governments&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Grandi said he used the climate emergency, and its connection to conflict and displacement, to convey the &ldquo;enormous complexity&rdquo; of refugee crises today.</p>\n<p>\n\tGlobally, roughly 103 million people have been forcibly displaced by persecution, conflict, violence, human rights violations and other factors.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Harsh winter for Ukrainians</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tUNHCR staff have responded to 37 emergencies around the world in the past 12 months alone, in countries such as Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Myanmar and Syria.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine has forced some 14 million people to flee their homes, sparking the fastest and largest displacement crisis in decades.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Ukrainians are about to face one of the world&rsquo;s harshest winters in extremely difficult circumstances. Humanitarian organizations have dramatically scaled up their response, but much more must be done, starting with an end to this senseless war,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Unfortunately, we see the opposite, and the destruction caused by strikes at civilian infrastructure, which happens as we speak, is quickly making the humanitarian response look like a drop in the ocean of needs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Safeguard humanitarian action</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Grandi concluded his remarks by stressing the need for action in four areas, starting with resources.&nbsp; Despite a record level of income, UNHCR is facing a major funding gap in some crucial areas, such as food aid for refugees.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also called for &ldquo;seriously strengthening peacebuilding&rdquo; in fragile countries, for example by reinforcing police, judicial and local government capacity, and overall rule of law.&nbsp; This is critical to both resolve displacement, by allowing refugees to return home, and to prevent conflict from recurring.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor his third point, Mr. Grandi stressed that humanitarian action must be better safeguarded, as threats are increasing, with deadly consequences. Warring parties must protect humanitarian work and enable access to people in need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Furthermore, everyone must uphold international humanitarian law and contribute to preserving the civilian character of refugee settings &ndash; an increasing challenge in many parts of the world. Armed elements must be separated from refugees, and those displaced and those needing protection must not be conflated with combatants,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Overcome your differences</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN refugee chief also presented another side of the duty of care issue, as millions of displaced and vulnerable people are living in areas under the control of non-State actors, or in countries under sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said no matter how polarised the context, aid workers must be able to operate wherever they are needed, which at times may involve &ldquo;uncomfortable interactions&rdquo; with those who control territory they need access to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;If I raise this&hellip;it is because we are often forced to negotiate humanitarian carve-outs, as they call them, case by case. I therefore welcome the current efforts in this Council to ensure greater predictability in these matters,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tHis final point was a call for the international community, and countries on the Council, to overcome their divisions and disagreements &ldquo;at least when you discuss humanitarian issues, and hopefully when you address or strive to address the root causes that are displacing people around the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>"

Even death is not enough.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Groundbreaking action plan</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA decade ago, countries endorsed the UN action plan which aims to protect journalists, prevent crimes against them, and pursue their perpetrators.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This groundbreaking document was adopted to acknowledge the vital work journalists do &ndash; for example when they report on conflicts and crises, or when they inquire into the workings of power and investigate corruption and other forms of injustice &ndash; as well as the risks they face when doing this,&rdquo; said Audrey Azoulay, the UNESCO Director-General.</p>\n<p>\n\tMuch progress has been made since the plan&rsquo;s adoption, she reported, with concrete measures implemented at the national, regional and global levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tUNESCO has also played a part, including through training nearly 36,000 judicial, law enforcement and security officials on issues such as freedom of expression and the security of journalists, including online.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, &ldquo;journalists continue to be killed at an alarming rate&rdquo;, said Ms. Azoulay.&nbsp; UNESCO data reveals that 955 journalists have lost their lives over the past decade, and 2022 has been the deadliest year since 2018.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>In war and peace</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Azoulay called for renewed commitment to protecting journalists everywhere, and at all times.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This means in situations of conflict and crisis, of course, and UNESCO is supporting journalists in Ukraine and Afghanistan, for instance.&nbsp; It also means in times of peace &ndash; for that is when most journalists have been killed in recent years,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UNESCO chief further called for stepping up efforts online, where new forms of violence have surfaced, especially targeting women, with three in four women journalists having experienced online harassment.</p>",

Some people.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tSunak is the UKs first British Asian Prime Minister and officially took over as Conservative leader and PM Tuesday after a leadership process, the BBC reported.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the original comments on the US programme, Noah - who is South African and grew up during apartheid - said: You hear a lot of the people saying Oh, theyre taking over, now the Indians are going to take over Great Britain and whats next?</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I always find myself going So what? What are you afraid of? I think its because the quiet part that a lot of people dont realise what theyre saying is, We dont want these people who were previously oppressed to get into power because then they may do to us what we did to them.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tDuring his skit, Noah played a clip from radio station LBC during the latest Conservative leadership race a week ago, when a caller falsely claimed Sunak was not even British.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJavid tweeted in response that the comments from the comedian were so wrong and that Britain is the most successful multiracial democracy on earth and proud of this historic achievement.</p>\n<p>\n\tFormer Tory leadership contender Rory Stewart said Noahs remarks were completely bizarre and an example of lazy stereotyping.</p>\n<p>\n\tDowning Street said Thursday that Sunak did not believe Britain was a racist country.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresenter Piers Morgan also tweeted that US media was falsely portraying Britain as a racist country.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tNoah finally responded on Friday evening, saying: Cmon Piers, youre smarter than that.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tI wasnt saying The entire UK is racist, I was responding to the racists who dont want Rishi as PM because of his race. Thats why I said.

Since the last Every Woman Every Child Progress Report published in 2020, food insecurity, hunger, child marriage, risks from intimate partner violence, and adolescent depression and anxiety have all increased.</p><p>‘Protect the promise’</p><p>The report, titled Protect the Promise, is published by global partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO), UN Children’s Fund UNICEF, the UN sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA, Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health (PMNCH) and Countdown to 2030, as a bi-annual summary of progress in response to the UN Secretary-General's Every Woman Every Child Global Strategy for Women, Children's and Adolescents' Health.</p><p>An estimated 25 million children were either under-vaccinated or not vaccinated at all in 2021 – 6 million more than in 2019 - increasing their risk of contracting deadly and debilitating diseases.</p><p>Millions of children missed out on school during the pandemic, many for more than a year, while approximately 80 per cent of children in 104 countries and territories experienced learning-loss because of school closures.</p><p>10.5 million lost parents, caregivers</p><p>Since the start of the global pandemic, 10.5 million children have lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19.</p><p>&quotAt the core of our unkept promise is the failure to address the gaping inequities at the root of global crises, from the COVID-19 pandemic to conflicts and the climate emergency&quot, said UN chief António Guterres.</p><p>&quotThe report describes the impacts of these crises on women, children and adolescents, from maternal mortality to education losses to severe malnutrition&quot.</p><p>Sharp decline</p><p>WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the COVID pandemic’s &quotlong-term impact on the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents is becoming evident - their chances for healthy and productive lives have declined sharply&quot.</p> <p>&quotAs the world emerges from the pandemic, protecting and promoting the health of women, children and young people is essential for supporting and sustaining the global recovery.&quot</p><p>UNICEF chief Catherine Russell said the pandemic has raised the stakes for all vulnerable communities, and reversed hard-won progress for women, children, and adolescents, &quotbut we are not powerless to change this…By investing in resilient, inclusive primary health care systems, jumpstarting routine immunization programmes, and strengthening the health workforce, we can make sure that every woman and every child can access the care they need to survive and thrive.&quot</p><p>Rights rolled back</p><p>&quotIn the face of increasing political pushback against sexual and reproductive health and rights in many countries, women, children and adolescents today are left without many of the protections of just a decade ago, and many others still have not seen the progress they need,&quot said Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director.</p><p>The report provides wide-ranging evidence that children and adolescents face wildly divergent chances of leading a healthy life simply based on where they are born, their exposure to conflict, and the economic circumstances of their families.</p><p>Statistics tell the story</p><p>A child born in a low-income country has an average life expectancy at birth of around 63 years, compared to 80 in a high-income country. In 2020, five million children died before their fifth birthday, mostly from preventable or treatable causes.</p><p>Most maternal, child, and adolescent deaths and stillbirths are concentrated in just two regions – sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</p><p>More than 45 million children had acute malnutrition in 2020, a life-threatening condition which leaves them vulnerable to death, developmental delays and disease. Nearly three-quarters of these children live in lower-middle-income countries.</p><p>A staggering 149 million children were stunted in 2020. Africa is the only region where the numbers of children affected by stunting increased over the past 20 years, from 54.4 million in 2000 to 61.4 million in 2020.</p><p>The six countries with the highest numbers of internally displaced persons – Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – are also among the top 10 food insecure countries.</p><p>A woman in sub-Saharan Africa has around a 130 times higher risk of dying from causes relating to pregnancy or childbirth than a woman in Europe or North America.</p><p>Millions of children and their families are experiencing poor physical and mental health from recent humanitarian disasters in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, Ukraine and Yemen. In 2021, a record 89.3 million people worldwide were driven from their homes by war, violence, persecution, and human rights abuse.</p><p>The report calls on the global community to address this damaging trajectory and protect the promises made to women, children, and adolescents in the SDGs.</p><p>In particular, it advocates for countries to continue investing in health services, to address all crises and food insecurity, and empower women and young people around the world.</p><p>World Health Summit pledge of $2.6 billion to end polio</p><p>Leaders meeting at the World Health Summit in Berlin on Tuesday, pledged an extra $2.6 billion in funding toward the Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s (GPEI) 2022-2026 Strategy to end polio.</p><p>The historic boost came at an event co-hosted by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), and the funds will support global efforts to overcome the final hurdles to polio eradication.</p><p>The extra cash will help fund vaccination for some 370 million children annually over the next five years, and continue disease surveillance across 50 countries, said WHO in a news release.</p><p>&quotNo place is safe until polio has been eradicated everywhere. As long as the virus still exists somewhere in the world, it can spread – including in our own country. We now have a realistic chance to eradicate polio completely, and we want to jointly seize that chance,&quot said Svenja Schulze, Germany’s Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p><p>Wild poliovirus is endemic in just two countries – Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, after just six cases were recorded in 2021, 29 cases have been recorded so far this year, including a small number of new detections in southeast Africa linked to a strain originating in Pakistan.</p><p>Additionally, outbreaks of polio variants that can emerge in places where not enough people have been immunized - continue to spread across parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, with new outbreaks detected in the United States, Israel and the United Kingdom in recent months.</p><p>&quotThe new detections of polio this year in previously polio-free countries are a stark reminder that if we do not deliver our goal of ending polio everywhere, it may resurge globally,&quot said WHO chief Tedros.</p><p>Image: © UNICEF/ Zahara Abdul</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\t&ldquo;I remain concerned at the number of outstanding issues, including on finance mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage and their inter linkages,&rdquo; COP27 President, Sameh Shoukry, told delegates reunited at the plenary of the Sharm el-Sheik International Convention Centre.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Shoukry called on parties to &ldquo;urgently&rdquo; work together to resolve the outstanding issues as swiftly as possible and added that he hopes to finalize the conference by Saturday.</p>\n<p>\n\tEarlier Friday morning, in an effort to spur the talks along, UN Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres met separately with members of the European Union and the Group of 77 and China &ndash; which comprises almost all developing countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN chief also met with China&rsquo;s Special Climate Envoy, Xie Zhenhua, and continued &ldquo;extensive consultations&rdquo; with several parties.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;As the negotiations draw to a close, the Secretary-General urges parties to aim for maximum ambition on loss and damage and in reduction of emissions,&rdquo; said Mr. Guterres in a note issued in Sharm el-Sheikh by his spokesperson.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe girl who scolded delegates</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Are there any other delegations that wish to make a statement?&rdquo; President Shoukry asked the so-called stocktaking plenary, where an update of progress has been held daily.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe delegation of Ghana requested the floor, and passed the microphone to 10-year-old Nakeeyat Dramani Sam.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe young activist then began to scold delegates for their seeming failure to take the climate catastrophe seriously: they would act faster to end global warming if they were her age, she declared.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;If all of you were young people like me, wouldn&rsquo;t you have already agreed to do what is needed to save our planet? Should we let the youth take over? Maybe only the youth delegation should be at the next COP&rdquo;, she said, igniting a standing ovation from all the delegates present.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Dramani Sam urged adults to &ldquo;have a heart&rdquo; and &ldquo;do the math&rdquo;, referring to the science that indicates the gravity of climate change in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;It is my real hope that COP27 will act for us. I&#39;m sure nobody wants to betray us,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe child activist also asked nations to dig into their pockets and provide funds for those suffering the most.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Some of the communities in my country are paying heavy prices since our planet was lit on fire by some people. This puts a simple question on the table&hellip;When can you pay us back? Because payment is overdue,&rdquo; she stated.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe text as it stands now...</p>\n<p>\n\tThe latest draft decision text was published overnight on Thursday.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe document reaffirms the 1.5C target to curb global warming and welcomes the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).</p>\n<p>\n\tIt also calls for &ldquo;deep, rapid emission cuts&rdquo; as well as an acceleration of clean energy transitions in the 2020s.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe text also keeps COP26 language on &ldquo;phasing down coal power&rdquo; and calls on Parties to &ldquo;rationalise fossil fuel subsidies&rdquo; and urges new climate action national plans (NDC&rsquo;s) by 2023.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe draft outcome welcomes the loss and damage agenda item, but it does not mention the creation or a funding facility.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso on Friday, the European Union presented an official proposal for creating a loss and damage fund, sparking hope for what some delegations from developing countries said might be a &ldquo;breakthrough&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&lsquo;COP stands on the precipice&rdquo;: NGOs</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, the reaction of civil society actors to the latest draft text and the slow-going negotiations has been made evident through press conferences and small protests all over the COP27 venue.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;COP27 really stands at a precipice,&rdquo; Catherine Abreu, from the NGO Destination Zero told journalists.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor her, this COP has an opportunity to make precedent by setting progress on loss and damage and a just transition to renewables and away from fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The Egyptian presidency and other countries involved in these negotiations have a choice. Do we walk out of this COP saying we have something tangible to bring home to our communities? &hellip; Or do we leave this COP with the same empty-handed promises that we&#39;ve left most COPs with over the last three decades,&rdquo; she added.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith that in mind, she then strongly urged a commitment to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees by accelerating the phase-out of all fossil fuels, and to address the harm being done to communities around the world.</p>\n<p>\n\tChiara Martinelly, Director of the Climate Action Network, referring to the issue of loss and damage, said that the &ldquo;money is there&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;It&rsquo;s good to hear the proposal from the UN Secretary-General, to dig into solutions for innovative sources of funding,&rdquo; she said, referring to the UN chief&rsquo;s opening plenary speech where he said that fossil fuel companies could be taxed to pay countries for the damages that climate change is causing all over the world.</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tThe session was led by Dr Ansu Sen, Consultant Neurologist, Dr Kaushik Majumdar Consultant Geriatric-Elderly Medicine and Rabindranath Ghosh Lead Physiotherapist, Manipal Hospital.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe participants included a total of 78 members of &ldquo;Kalinidi Senior Citizen Welfare Association &ldquo;.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Stroke is among those medical emergencies of adult life that rank first in frequency and importance. It needs immediate medical attention with widespread awareness to help save lives and post-stroke complications.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Elderly people are at higher risk of stroke in comparison to the younger population and the risk of stroke doubles every ten years after the age of 55.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Stroke can be due to high BP, smoking and alcohol habits, genetics, obesity and with advancing age.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tStroke requires immediate treatment and a session on stroke management had helped to cater a large number of people about the symptoms, prevention, care and also how to lead a healthy life.</p>\n<p>\n\tDr Ansu Sen, Consultant Neurologist at Manipal Hospital Salt Lake Kolkata, said, &ldquo;A stitch in time saves nine. Similarly paying attention to a&nbsp; mini-stroke can minimize the risk of full-scale stroke, hence identifying the symptom of a stroke is very important for its timely treatment. The session on stroke enabled us to teach the participants how to identify the symptoms of stroke with the help of simple tips.&quot;</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&lsquo;FAST&rsquo;, explained simply as F- Face, A-Arm, S- Speech and T- Time identification, helps to identify if the person is having a stroke or not.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>They need to be asked to smile to check if the face of the patient droops or not, check the arm movement, the speech whether the patient&rsquo;s speech is slurry and lastly the time is vital as any treatment is successful when provided on time. The session was imperative for all the learners and emphasised on how all of us can be cautious about stroke.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tDr.Kaushik Majumdar Consultant Geriatric-Elderly Medicine, Manipal Hospital Salt Lake Kolkata, said, &ldquo;Treatment methodologies of a senior person is quite different from that of an adult as various factors are associated behind a medical condition in them.&nbsp; The advancing age and lifestyle pose challenges in adapting to various changes; therefore, it becomes important for us to provide the elderly with simple regimes that would be easier for them to<br />\n\tfollow.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;In this session I have advised the participants to undergo simple exercises within their physical capacity, inclusion of seasonal vegetables and fruits in the diet, taking adequate amount of fluid, regular health monitoring and participating in various medical camps organised by the hospital as these sessions are of immense knowledge and helpful for all.&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tGeriatrics is the medical speciality that deals with both medical and psychological aspects of treatment keeping in mind the socio-economic problems among senior citizens. Some of the common problems associated with old age are cataract, hypertension, diabetes, brain attack, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease etc.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>It is crucial to identify the symptoms for the disease and that every sign may not be due to pathological reasons and can be simply due to ageing. Most common symptoms include lack sleep, appetite, lack of concentration, including eye-sight and hearing problems.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The symptoms may not seem alarming but consulting a doctor is advisable for minimizing chances of any further complications.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tArindam Banerjee, Director Manipal Hospital Salt Lake Kolkata, said, &ldquo;As the population ages, the risk of stroke also advances and it is our general duty to create awareness among the senior citizens regarding stroke, its prevention, and cure. Our doctors at Manipal Hospital have played an indispensable role by spreading awareness and conducting a knowledgeable sessions with the senior citizens. Manipal Hospital is in a continuous process to develop the act of prompt recognising and taking action for the symptoms of the diseases and the hospital will continue to take such initiative for every individual.&rdquo;</p>"

The blame game is a recipe for mutually assured destruction,&rdquo; Ant&oacute;nio Guterres told journalists at the Sharm el-Sheikh International Conference Centre.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN chief urged countries to deliver the kind of meaningful action that people, and the planet, so desperately need.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The world is watching and has a simple message: stand and deliver,&rdquo; he underscored.</p>\n<p>\n\tAction on loss and damage</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Guterres reminded world leaders that global emissions are at their highest levels in history, and climate impacts are decimating economies and societies.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The most effective way to rebuild trust is by finding an ambitious and credible agreement on loss and damage and financial support to developing countries. The time for talking on loss and damage finance is over. We need action,&rdquo; he stated, urging negotiators to deliver concrete solutions to resolve one of the thorniest issues on the table at this year&rsquo;s COP, or Conference of Parties, to the UN climate convention.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN chief also asked negotiators to send a clear signal that the voices of those on the frontlines of the crisis are being heard, while the world burning and drowning before their eyes.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Reflect the urgency, scale and enormity of the challenge faced by developing countries. We cannot continue to deny climate justice to those who have contributed least to the climate crisis and are getting hurt the most,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the first time in the history of UN climate conferences, the issue of loss and damage has been included in the official agenda.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe creation of a new financial facility to compensate for the losses suffered by vulnerable countries hit hardest by natural disasters, is a key demand by the negotiating bloc known as the Group of the 77, which represents nearly all developing countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tRenewables: &lsquo;the exit ramp off the highway to hell&rsquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary-General also touched on another issue that has troubled climate activists in the past days: keeping up the ambition to curb global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The 1.5 target is not simply about keeping a goal alive &ndash; it&rsquo;s about keeping people alive. I see the will to keep to the 1.5 goal &ndash; but we must ensure that commitment is evident in the COP27 outcome,&rdquo; he said, adding that the current fossil fuel companies&rsquo; expansion is &ldquo;hijacking humanity&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tOnce again, Mr. Guterres made the case for renewables, and a global Climate Solidarity Pact with developed countries taking the lead in reducing emissions.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;A Pact with developed countries taking the lead in reducing emissions. And a Pact to mobilize &ndash; together with International Financial Institutions and the private sector &ndash; financial and technical support for emerging economies to accelerate their transition to renewable energy,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Guterres underscored that renewables are the &ldquo;exit ramp from the climate hell highway&rdquo;, referring to one of the most powerful messages from his speech last week at the opening of COP27.</p>\n<p>\n\tDeliver the money</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN Secretary-General also asked for the delivery of the $100 billion annually in climate finance promised at COP15 in Copenhagen.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe asked the Parties to act in consensus to double their investments in adaptation and reform multilateral development banks and international financial institutions.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;They must provide the support developing countries need to embark on a renewable energy and climate-resilient pathway&rdquo;, he highlighted.</p>\n<p>\n\t&lsquo;The clock is ticking&rsquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, Mr. Guterres reminded negotiators that the &ldquo;climate clock is ticking&rdquo; and that they have a chance to make a difference, so they must act quickly.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We have agreed solutions in front of us &ndash; to respond to loss and damage, to close the emissions gap, and to deliver on finance&rdquo;, he concluded.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday morning, a draft of the final decision, or cover text, was published by the COP27 Presidency. However, NGO experts said that the 20-page document is still just a list of options that must be edited down.</p>\n<p>\n\tTweet URL</p>\n<p>\n\tThe current text addresses the 1.5 target and refers to science, reiterates the Glasgow Climate Pact call to phase down coal but does not mention oil and gas. It also references the doubling of adaptation finance and welcomes the agenda item on loss and damage, but it doesn&rsquo;t call for the establishment of a new financial facility.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe People&rsquo;s plenary</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Thursday, hundreds of civil society representatives took over the COP27 plenary to demand climate justice, touching on the very action points the Secretary-General mentioned later at his press encounter.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe ceremony started with a blessing from the indigenous peoples of Brazil, reflecting the important role of spirituality as part of climate action.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We are all connected, humans and non-humans&hellip; everything is sacred and what was created can&rsquo;t be part of a market. Nature is life&rdquo;, said the group&rsquo;s chief.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe so-called People&rsquo;s Plenary, which takes place every year at the UN climate summits, this year featured the representatives of the constituencies of indigenous peoples, women, youth and workers, among others.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne after the other, activists shared their vision and experience regarding climate change, and spoke about the human rights which, they underscored, are being violated by the current crisis.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Incredible young people from the global North and the global South are standing together in solidarity asking for action. But we need to look for more than hope.&nbsp; We need those in power to actually listen and implement the solutions,&rdquo; the leader of the Youth constituency declared.</p>\n<p>\n\tA march and a sit-in for justice</p>\n<p>\n\tAfter meeting at the plenary, all attendants walked out and did a short march at the outdoor area of the Sharm el-Sheikh International Convention Centre that ended with a sit-in, at which they read the COP27 People&rsquo;s Declaration for Climate Justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe document endorsed by the dozens of organizations present, calls for a &ldquo;system change&rdquo; to ensure and enable just transitions to 100 per cent peoples-owned decentralised renewable energy systems, the repayment of climate debt by reducing emissions to real zero by 2030 and addressing loss and damage, the phase-out of fossil fuels, and to ensure a safe and enabling environment for civil society.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here because I&#39;m angry. My communities have already been impacted by an ongoing drought for the past decade. My people have not seen any rain for the past ten years. Their livelihoods are being impacted already,&rdquo; Ina Maria Shikongo, an indigenous activist from Namibia, told UN News.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Shikongo said that Namibia is currently one of the driest countries in Southern Africa and yet global leaders are still debating whether they should pay for loss and damage.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Our governments keep on borrowing funds just to be able to support communities when we are the least responsible for the climate crisis. Namibia is a carbon sink, so that means that the global North, they do owe us climate reparations,&rdquo; she underscored.</p>\n<p>\n\tSolutions Day</p>\n<p>\n\tThursday was officially &lsquo;Solutions Day&rsquo; at COP27.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Ms. Shikongo, the answers to the climate crisis lie with the world&rsquo;s indigenous communities.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We should be the ones on the table. We should be the ones as indigenous nations [are among the most impacted] communities. We should be there. We have the solutions. Indigenous people have the solutions, but they refuse to listen to them,&rdquo; she denounced.</p>\n<p>\n\tPolish activist Dominika Lasota told UN News that she is at COP27 to promote the end of fossil fuels, which she believes are driving the war in Ukraine.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Lasota said that community renewable projects should be the main solution to the climate crisis, and also highlighted that indigenous communities, which have been protecting the planet&rsquo;s ecosystems for centuries, should be heard.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We desperately need to redirect the money from the death, from fossil fuels and from investments that destroy our lives, and into solutions and into things that protect the light of indigenous peoples, such as loss and damage finance,&rdquo; she underscored.<br />\n\t&nbsp;</p>"

It provides habitat for species, but it also stores carbon. So, it has both a mitigation and an adaptation dimension,&rdquo; Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director, told UN News.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Coral reefs get a new defender at COP27</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, biodiversity is affected by extreme weather events and temperatures, especially in developing countries, due to limited resources to protect them. This is worrying, since 15 of the 17 countries with the largest biodiversity are in the global South.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe effects of climate change on biodiversity are already visible, especially with many animal species already forced to change migration patterns, plants struggling to adapt to changes in temperature, and of course seriously vulnerable polar bears &ndash; the &lsquo;poster animals&rsquo; of global warming &ndash; starving at the North Pole due to the lack of sea ice in a warming world.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the ocean, biologists are witnessing another tragedy as coral reefs, which provide food and shelter for over 7,000 other species, are dying because of the warming and acidification of the ocean.</p>\n<p>\n\tUNEP Goodwill Ambassador, Ellie Goulding launched a new initiative at COP27 aimed to protect these colonial animals.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week, she led an expedition in the Red Sea, off the coast of Sharm el-Sheikh.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;There&#39;s this sheer visual beauty. When you pass through with your mask and witness this brilliant cornucopia of marine life, you feel as if all life is swimming in front of your eyes. And it reminded me that coral covers just a tiny percentage of the sea floor, but it supports a quarter of all known marine species,&rdquo; she told a panel on Wednesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Goulding reminded participants that even at 1.5C degrees of warming, 70 to 90 pe cent of all reefs will be lost; this number jumps to a worrying 99 per cent if our planet warms by 2.0 degrees C.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This is one of the most climate tolerant reefs in the world, and it just happens to be right here at your feet in Sharm el-Sheikh. And this is no ordinary reef. It&rsquo;s one of nature&rsquo;s great survivors and it could be the key to regenerating other reefs in the future,&rdquo; she explained.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe singer-songwriter said it was &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; that less than 0.01 per cent of climate finance is devoted to protecting coral reefs.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I ask the global community of leaders to acknowledge that coral reefs are one of our greatest collective assets and to get seriously, seriously ambitious and competitive about funding, restoration and protection,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Forests, the Amazon and promises</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tImportant pledges aimed at protecting forests were made last year at COP26 in Glasgow.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Some of them are beginning to roll off the belt onto reality. But there&rsquo;s a reason why Egypt framed this as the &lsquo;implementation COP&rsquo;; because those pledges and promises have to see real action,&rdquo; stated UNEP chief Andersen.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week, the European Union also announced a new cooperation framework on reversing deforestation in Guyana, Mongolia, the Republic of Congo, Uganda and Zambia.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Wednesday, Luiz In&aacute;cio Lula da Silva, President-Elect of Brazil, drew a huge crowd at the pavilions and a meeting room in the afternoon as he stressed that his country would put up a very strong fight against illegal deforestation in the Amazon. He also announced that Brazil aims to host COP30 in 2025.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Lula da Silva also announced the creation of an indigenous ministry in his new administration.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;He will place a major emphasis on the Amazon and on tropical forests. And that is, of course, a massive gain for climate, for biodiversity and for the people of the Amazon,&rdquo; Ms. Andersen said, reacting to the Brazilian leader&rsquo;s announcements.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Egyptian COP27 Presidency also announced today a series of initiatives related to protecting biodiversity.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;We need action now&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIndigenous activists, who have made a strong showing since the start of COP27, were especially vocal today, as they are the guardians of our planet&rsquo;s biodiversity.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;My community was hit by two cyclones in just one year and our [entire] city was completely destroyed. We don&rsquo;t want to live like this anymore. We need a safe space; we need a safe planet,&rdquo; Adriana da Silva Maffioletti, a young activist from Brazil told UN News.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe added that she hoped world leaders would listen to the indigenous leadership instead of exploiting them.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Indigenous people have the most sustainable way to live. So, we must learn from them and not put them aside in this fight. We protect over 80 per cent of the planet&rsquo;s biodiversity,&rdquo; she explained.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Da Silva Maffioletti underscored that her people &ndash; their voices, experience and ideas &ndash; should be the number one priority in the fight against climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This is not something for tomorrow. This is not something for 10 years [from now]. This is something for us to do right now. The climate crisis is affecting and killing people right now. So, we must act now,&rdquo; she declared.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We are not going to give up on this fight. Extractive companies, and even some wind energy projects that wear ae not being consulted [on] are affecting Mother Earth, our sources, our medicine,&rdquo; Yenilin Aurielen Lubo Bonivento, from the Guayu community in Colombia, also told UN News.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe comes from the Guajira department in the north of the South American nation, an area among the most affected by climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe is also a biologist and is currently teaching young girls in her community about science.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We need to raise our voices, and [draw on the] science, combined with our ancestral knowledge. This is the key to fighting climate change.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Updates on negotiations</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tRegarding negotiations, the Egyptian COP27 Presidency reported on Wednesday that unfortunately, many delegations are &ldquo;holding back&rdquo; a number of negotiation rooms.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We would have hoped under the current circumstances to see more willingness to cooperate and accommodate than we are seeing in the reports that we receive from the various negotiating tracks. I [will] reserve the verdict: perhaps some countries and delegations will show more openness and accommodation as the last minute comes,&rdquo; Ambassador Wael Aboulgmagd, Special Representative for the COP27 President, told journalists.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added that, when negotiators were adopting the agenda, which includes for the first time a &#39;loss and damage&#39; item, they only had &ldquo;a breakthrough&rdquo; at the last hour.</p>\n<p>\n\tUN News spoke with Ruanna Hayes, negotiator from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), who confirmed that the discussions are not especially hopeful at the moment.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;There&rsquo;s real concern about how things are progressing across the board. Of course, loss and damage is a key issue, the key outcome that the Alliance is looking for from this COP, and things are still not coming together,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpecial Representative Aboulgmagd sent a message to negotiators, reminding them that although every delegation must consider its national interests, the situation [of climate change] is dire, as the science reports show.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I hope delegations in the negotiation rooms take this to heart and realize that they need to show progress, not in words but in action and implementation,&rdquo; he said.</p>"

What are your views on the future of medical AI (Artificial Intelligence)?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn future it will complement the doctors in improving their accuracy and save time as doctors are very busy. Thus, with the help of AI, the doctor can give more time to their patients. My student has submitted a thesis on AI in lung cancer and its algorithmic approach. We are preparing a software tool for detecting lung cancer with the help of improved AI. In different spheres of healthcare, be it radiology, oncology decision making, personalised medicine, therapeutic or diagnostic, in my idea AI is going to be a game changer.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q. What are your views on the current situation of doctor patient relationship?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMy take on the doctor-patient relationship is that as the information becomes more available to the general public, they will ask more questions which is a good sign which shows that they are actively participating in medical decision making. But as doctors, we tend to be a bit authoritative and not like too many questions, so I think it would be a challenge for us doctors and we are going to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tAs far as the behaviour of the patients and their families towards doctors, it is a both way traffic. The doctor has to be polite and be very sensitive. And the patient and their family must realise that it is not an easy job, as it carries human lives at risk and because of this pressure the doctor may not answer all questions asked by the patient party. In our country, in my clinical practice, I find that the patient and their family totally surrender to the goodwill of the doctor.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Q. As we are transitioning from British medicine to American medicine, how could one keep up with the sheer intensity of tests prescribed by the doctors?</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to me, we are progressing towards Indian medicine because with so much pressure with so few resources we improvise and we are innovative. No American medicine could teach us to achieve this level of accuracy with so much improvisation. Only Indian medicine could do that. Tests and parameters should be used judiciously. Each doctor adapts to the scenario. I believe that there is not one system of medicine but it&rsquo;s an improvised system moulded according to the needs and resources.</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tThe energy sector, responsible for more than two-thirds of global greenhouse emissions, is mainly powered by fossil fuels. While this brings electricity and transport to most of the world, it is accompanied by deep pain and loss to vulnerable communities and ecosystems.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the International Renewable Agency (IRENA), only 29 per cent of global electricity generation currently comes from renewables, and carbon emissions continue an upward trend.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface. And the one year since Glasgow, frankly, has been a year of climate procrastination. By 2030, we need to reduce emissions by between 30 to 45 per cent, but since COP26 we&rsquo;ve shaved off one per cent. So, we have a long way to go,&rdquo; the UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) chief, Inger Andersen, told an event in Sharm el-Sheikh, the site of this year&rsquo;s UN-facilitated climate talks.</p>\n<p>\n\tAndersen noted that we currently live in a world that has warmed 1.1 degrees Celsius since the preindustrial era, and we are already seeing an increase in storms, droughts, floods, and crop failures.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The current policies take us to a 2.8 degrees world&hellip;It is important that we have a conversation about emissions reduction and who carries the load. The G20, which are meeting this very week... have a collective responsibility for 75 per cent of all emissions,&rdquo; she underscored, asking for these economies to invest in climate finance and &ldquo;climate justice&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The goal is still 1.5 degrees</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSimon Stiell, UN Climate Change (UNFCCC) Executive Secretary, also stressed the importance of curbing global warming to 1.5 degrees, saying that it is a goal set by the Paris Agreement but also grounded firmly in science and hard data.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Anything beyond a 1.5 rise increases the risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth. For many, it is already a living hell&hellip; every fraction of a degree beyond 1.5 increasingly puts human life on this planet in peril,&rdquo; he emphasized, calling on countries to be &ldquo;rigorous&rdquo; in their efforts to uphold their commitments in the Glasgow Climate Pact to keep 1.5 in sight.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Stiell, who on Monday called on parties to &ldquo;bridge the divide&rdquo; in Sharm el-Sheikh to ensure rapid action on mitigation, adaptation, loss and damage finance and accountability, encouraged nations to come out with &ldquo;substantive positions&rdquo; to move forward on these issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Some positive developments</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN climate chief noted positively that South Africa has launched a multimillion-dollar plan to shift from coal towards green energy, calling it a key moment in the global push for the transition away from fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We anticipate hearing more ambition in this area when G20 ministers meet this week in Bali. So, we are making headway at COP27, but moving further and faster also means action beyond COP to drive down emissions,&rdquo; he emphasized.</p>\n<p>\n\tIndeed, at the G20 in Bali, a coalition of countries, led by the United States and Japan, announced that they will be investing $20 billion to sharply reduce Indonesia&rsquo;s reliance on coal and to transition the Southeast Asian nation to renewable power.</p>\n<p>\n\tCurrently, Indonesia is one the world&rsquo;s largest consumers of coal and the world&#39;s fifth largest greenhouse emitter.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The tools are there, we just need to use them</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to Jim Skea, a scientist and member of the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the world has seen major developments in terms of renewable energy, with costs falling and deployment going up in the past years.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Half the world&rsquo;s emissions are now covered by climate legislation. A fifth of the world&rsquo;s emissions is covered by carbon prices. So, people haven&rsquo;t quite used all the tools yet, but they&rsquo;ve got [them] on the workbench. And if people have enough willpower to do it, big things can happen,&rdquo; he told UN News.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Skea underscored that the IPCC reports make clear that in the short-term there should be &ldquo;huge&rdquo; reductions in coal use, medium in terms of oil, and modest reductions in terms of gas to keep the 1.5 scenario reachable.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We need see gas use to be 45 per cent lower by 2050. That&rsquo;s a 2 per cent reduction per year. And frankly, existing gas fields will deplete faster than that,&rdquo; the scientist explained, clarifying that the world needs to &ldquo;exit&rdquo; all fossil fuels, but perhaps, at different speeds.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The future of energy</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, Francesco La Camera, IRENA Director General, explained that the future of energy systems will be based largely on renewables and complemented by green hydrogen and the sustainable use of biomass.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Today we have less than one-third renewable, two-thirds of fossil fuel in the energy system. We will have a completely different situation in 2050 where renewables and clean energy will be the more than two-thirds of energy&hellip; everything is changing,&rdquo; he said, pointing out, echoing Mr. Skea, that solar and wind energy solutions have had a two-digit price reduction in the last two years.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe added that renewables can generate three times more jobs than equal investment in the fossil fuel sector could, as well as contribute more to countries&rsquo; GDP.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The Ukraine crisis has certified the end of energy system centralized on fossil fuels. Governments have suddenly discovered that we cannot have 80 per cent of the country dependent on fossil fuel and everyone wants now to go for a system that could be more independent,&rdquo; the expert argued.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, he said that while the transition is underway, it is not happening at the speed and scale needed to achieve the Paris Agreement&rsquo;s goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tOil and gas projects still expanding, civil society decries</p>\n<p>\n\tTuesday was also &lsquo;Civil Society&rsquo; Day at COP27.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast week, Urgewald, along with 50 other NGO partners, launched their yearly 2022 Global Oil &amp; Gas Exit List, a public company-level database that covers 901 oil and gas companies, which account for 95 per cent of global oil and gas production.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe report revealed that 96 per cent of the oil and gas industry is expanding, and many financial institutions and banks continue making related investments, even when many have signed up pledges to &ldquo;go Net-Zero&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn Tuesday, Heffa Schuecking, Urgenwald Director, told journalists about the groups&rsquo; findings regarding the African content.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We see new fossil fuel projects in 48 out of 55 African countries and these projects can be traced back to 200 companies. While the discussions are ongoing here at COP, we see a disconnect with what is happening in Egypt and in the rest of Africa. In Egypt alone, we have 55 companies prospecting for new gas discovery,&rdquo; she stated.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Schuecking, said that around $5 billion is currently being spent by companies on oil and gas exploration in Africa, and denounced this as a waste of money, especially when taking in account the potential for renewable energy in the continent.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;If we compare the investments going into the fossil side and going into the renewable side it&rsquo;s a huge gap, I&#39;&#39;s enormous. We&rsquo;re investing in the wrong place,&rdquo; she lamented, adding that fossil fuel companies are opening a new sort of frontiers, with oil explorations now even planned in Namibia, where there hadn&rsquo;t been any oil and gas expansion until now.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This is not just about climate; this is about destruction of nature. This is about the destruction of people&rsquo;s health. This is about displacement and impoverishment of communities,&rdquo; she underscored, pointing out that most of the companies carrying out these projects are not African, but are headquartered in Europe, United States and China.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A painful reality</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tFor Odudu-Abasi James Asuquo, this is not a far-off reality. Her community and family in Nigeria have experienced firsthand the consequences of oil and gas exploration</p>\n<p>\n\tShe&rsquo;s an Ogoni, a community in the Niger Delta region of southern Nigeria which has been victimized by oil corporations for decades. The community rose to international attention in 2017 after massive public protests against Shell Oil.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I lose people every day. My community has been killed and has been destroyed. I&rsquo;m so scared of bringing a child into the world and I&rsquo;m just a young person. I&rsquo;m afraid for my future,&rdquo; she told UN News.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. James Asuquo said that her entire community is now living in and camp for internally displaced persons (IDPs) after the entire Rivers state [region of the Nier Delta] was flooded.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;My community needs a lot of help. Governments need to wake up. Climate change is not a statistic, it&rsquo;s a reality. For me, it&rsquo;s my daily life. I lost my parents; I lost my people. I don&rsquo;t have a life. I don&rsquo;t even have a home to go back to because there&rsquo;s no land. The water is polluted. The air is polluted. So, climate change is my reality,&rdquo; she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2011, UNEP carried out an assessment in the territory the youth activist is from and discovered that the impact of 50 years of oil production in the region extended deeper than previously thought.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause of oil spills, oil flaring, and waste discharge, the alluvial soil of the Niger Delta is no longer viable for agriculture. Further, in many areas once thought to be unaffected, the groundwater has since been found to contain high levels of hydrocarbons, or to have been contaminated with benzene, a carcinogen, at 900 levels above World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;They are talking about 2030 and I don&rsquo;t have that. They are talking about 2024 I am not sure about that either. My community needs the help now and today is the day for action,&rdquo; she declared, adding that wealthy countries should pay their debt with the global South.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;They have to pay us what they owe because they destroyed us. We shouldn&rsquo;t have to beg for it.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&ldquo;Keep it in the text&rdquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOn Monday night, the COP27 Presidency released a document containing the summary of possible elements put forward by parties for inclusion in the conference&#39;s final outcome, which is expected to be drafted by Wednesday.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe document contains items of interest expressed by parties related to mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage, among many other issues.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We have to come out of this COP with clear pathway towards 1.5,&rdquo; Tongan activist Joseph-Zane Sikulu, told UN News, underscoring that this year&rsquo;s outcome text should include the phrase &lsquo;phasing out all fossil fuels&rsquo;, not only coal.</p>\n<p>\n\tMiriam Hinostroza, Environmental Economist from UNEP, talked with UN News about some of the complexities in negotiations related to phasing out fossil fuels in developing countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Sometimes, a priority for countries is economic growth, which they only get from using fossil fuels &ndash; they are still cheap the technologies are there, there are many power plants [and] they cannot [all of a sudden] just get rid of these plants. So, there is this issue on the stranded assets &ndash; what to do with all these investments, all these technologies,&rdquo; she said, arguing that to force countries to get rid of fossil fuels in the next five on 10 years is unfortunately, &ldquo;not a reality&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Loss and damage</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOn the loss and damage agenda, the top issue this year pushed by developing countries, the Presidency released a draft text on Tuesday, which includes matters related to finance with various options, one of them creating a new financial mechanism.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Pledges to reduce emissions, to improve adaptation measures, to repair loss and damage, and pledges to increase financing &ndash; all need to be put into action,&rdquo; the President of the current session of the UN General Assembly told delegates attending a plenary session this morning.</p>\n<p>\n\tCsaba Kőr&ouml;si reminded them that COP27 is &ldquo;the implementation COP&rdquo; and said that it was the moment to bridge the gaps between pledges and fulfilment.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also called on delegates to ask themselves if &ldquo;the glass will be half full or half empty&rdquo; by the end of the conference.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The glass will be full when we fulfil our pledges and use the solutions we already have. This glass will be full when we overcome procedure debates and can fully focus on how to address transformation to a water and climate safe development path. So let it be a full glass,&rdquo; he urged.</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tTo meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis, the world must abandon fossil fuels as quickly as possible, Selwin Hart, Special Adviser to the Secretary-General on Climate Action told UN News today.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;There is no argument around the science at all. But of course, developing countries, especially the poorest, will need assistance to make the transition to a renewable energy future,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Hart, who is from the small island nation of Barbados and has acted as a negotiator in the past during several UN Climate Conferences (COPs), underscored that the focus should be on helping remove the barriers that developing countries face to accelerate their transition to renewables.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;For example, the cost of capital. Renewable energy investments by their nature are very capital intensive. Eighty per cent of the investment must be upfront, because you have to buy the solar panels and the battery storage and the installation, and that&rsquo;s costly&rdquo;, he highlighted, adding, however, that the running costs are zero because there is no need to buy any oil or diesel to power a renewable energy station.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A striking comparison</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe expert gave us a striking example of the unfair conditions countries in the developing world face when it comes to the energy transition.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll compare Algeria and Denmark. Denmark has some of the worst potentials for renewable energy [while] Algeria&rsquo;s potential for renewable energy is probably 70 times higher. But Denmark has seven times more solar panels than Algeria. The reason is the cost of capital,&rdquo; he explained, referring to the return expected by those who provide capital for business.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe international community needs to &ldquo;throw the kitchen sink&rdquo; at solving this problem, he stated.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Mr. Hart, mobilizing the trillions of dollars needed to make the transition should be the focus, instead of pouring capital into new fossil fuel projects, which he sees as a real risk that could lead to investing in stranded assets or passing debts onto future generations.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Fossil fuels are a dead end, as a Secretary-General has said&hellip;We need to increase renewable energy deployment to around 60 per cent of total energy capacity over the course of the next eight years, which means roughly a tripling of install capacity over the course of this decade,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd for the expert, this is more than possible, because the world has tripled its renewable energy capacity over the last decade.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We just need to do it again this decade. The technologies are there, the finance is there. It just needs to be deployed in the right place, where the emissions are and where the population growth and energy demand is&rdquo;, he urged.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Decarbonizing the industry</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tDecarbonization is shorthand for finding alternative ways of living and working that reduce emissions and capture and store carbon in our soil and vegetation. It requires a radical change in our current economic model which is focused on growth at all costs.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs &lsquo;Decarbonization Day&rsquo; got underway at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, a new report from the United Nations underscored the importance of rapid and large-scale action to tackle greenhouse gas emissions from the energy-intensive countries, which account for about 25 per cent of the total CO2 emissions globally and 66 per cent in the industrial sector.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe study singles out the cement, iron and steel, and chemicals and petrochemical industries as the most significant emitters and identifies key practical measures for them to transition to a carbon-neutral economy.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Adopting circular economy approaches to help reduce needs for new materials will be crucial in this respect. Solutions must be implemented without delay&rdquo; the Executive Secretary of the UN European Economic Comission, Olga Algayerova, said in a statement.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe key recommendation is indeed &ldquo;a circular carbon economy&rdquo;, based on carbon reduction, capture reuse and removal, as well as a push for innovation and research to tackle the challenge presented by the need for high temperatures and chemical processes required that are currently most efficiently reached by burning fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnother key recommendation is the creation of industrial clusters to &ldquo;share emissions&rdquo; and reduce costs, creating green and sustainable jobs. You can learn more about this here.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The &lsquo;Breakthrough Agenda&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, a so-called master plan to accelerate the decarbonization of five major sectors &ndash; power, road transport, steel, hydrogen, and agriculture &ndash; was also presented this Friday by the COP27 Presidency.</p>\n<p>\n\tGovernments representing over half of the global GDP, including the United States and the United Kingdom, set out a 12-month action plan with 25 collaborative actions to be delivered by COP28 to help make clean technologies cheaper and more accessible everywhere.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe plan has emerged as part of the so-named Breakthrough Agenda, an initiative launched last year during COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>\n<p>\n\tThrough the plan, actions target sectors accounting for more than 50 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions and are also designed to reduce energy costs and enhance food security, with the building and cement sectors to be added to next year.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe outlined Priority Actions include agreements to develop common definitions for low-emission and near-zero emission steel, hydrogen and sustainable batteries, as well as ramping up clean infrastructure projects, setting a common target to phase out polluting vehicles and stimulate global demand for green industrial goods.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The Fashion industry can contribute, too</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAnother sector on the spotlight for its potential for decarbonization was the fashion industry, which is responsible for 18 to 20 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2018, industry leaders created the Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, with a vision to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p>\n<p>\n\tFocusing on the ambitions of the charter, a side event at COP27 examined the importance of decarbonization across the entire fashion supply chain, from production of raw materials, manufacturing to distribution.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The message is clear: to brands, stop lying, stop greenwashing; and to consumers, stop buying fast and furiously,&rdquo; implored Sophia Kianni, a member of the Secretary-General&rsquo;s Advisory Group on Climate Change, addressing the &lsquo;Race to Zero&rsquo; event.</p>\n<p>\n\tCivil society mobilises to keep fossil fuels in the ground</p>\n<p>\n\tThe country and civil society pavilions at COP27 saw another busy day on Friday with a long list of side events focused on the theme of decarbonization.</p>\n<p>\n\tMany interactive projects, including a room-sized game that simulates the energy transition to net-zero, were presented, trying to give participants ideas about what the future could look like if the right decisions are taken.</p>\n<p>\n\tProtesters were also out in force again today, including a group of medical doctors who were giving CPR to a globe of Earth, as a way to symbolize the health consequences of climate change, as well as a group of African faith-based representatives who danced in circles shouting, &ldquo;No more fossil fuels!&rdquo; and demanding action &ldquo;now&rsquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;By COP28, maybe Africa will bring corpses to Dubai. Maybe we won&rsquo;t be participating because climate change would have wiped out the continent. We are not appealing, we are demanding that the climate debt be paid for Africa, which contributed little or nothing to the changing climate&rdquo; said a Ugandan activist from the NGO Greenfaith.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Our message is simple: &ldquo;Keep fossil fuels in the ground.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Solutions for decarbonization</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tOther members of civil society are also promoting ground-up solutions to help decarbonize our societies.</p>\n<p>\n\tMichelle Li, founder of the organization Clever Carbon, promotes carbon footprint literacy to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, reach net-zero targets faster, and create scalable technologies and solutions.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Carbon literacy is knowing the carbon footprint of our daily decisions from our diet to the way we commute. A vegetarian meal is on average 600g of carbon emissions, a serving of chicken is 1300g, serving of beef is 7,700 g. Carbon literacy is also the knowledge that the CO2 concentration in our atmosphere is currently 420ppm. If we surpass 450ppm we will surpass the 1.5C goal&rdquo;, she explained to UN News.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor Ms. Li, carbon literacy is a tool that can scale quickly and remove gigatons of CO2 from our atmosphere.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;It is not rocket science and can be deployed today. As we look to decarbonization and retrofit buildings and transition our energy, carbon literacy for leaders, policymakers, and citizens can help us accelerate decarbonization and create more scalable climate solutions,&rdquo; she underscored.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Halfway point of the negotiations</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAmbassador Wael Aboulgmagd, Special Representative for the COP27 Egyptian Presidency, held a press conference to announce that there is &ldquo;good progress&rdquo; in many areas of the negotiations.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Negotiations on quite a few items are complex. For items such as the mitigation work program, the global goal on adaptation, or funding arrangements to address loss of damage, we at least see parties are working very hard and there is some progress being made,&rdquo; he said</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Aboulgmagd said negotiators have agreed to now extend negotiations beyond 6 pm every day, to give additional time for parties to achieve &ldquo;meaningful outcomes&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile negotiations address specific agenda items agreed before the conference and are based mostly on technical implementation this year, the &lsquo;cover decision&rsquo;, which is the final binding document that will be agreed by countries, includes other contributions.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The first meeting on the cover decisions will be held tomorrow to listen to parties&#39; expectations&rdquo;, the COP7 Presidency representative explained.</p>\n<p>\n\tMinisters are also expected to arrive next week, which, according to Selwin Hart, will be the time devoted to resolving some of the big-picture political issues.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, NGO participants continued putting pressure on negotiators to deliver more than just technical agreements in the final decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The only way we can pull in these aspirations and hopes of the vulnerable people, including those in Africa, is for them [negotiators] to articulate a comprehensive vision that helps progress, particularly around adaptation, loss and damage and justice,&rdquo; said Sindra Sharma, Global Policy Lead of Climate Action International.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Sharma added that there is no &ldquo;Africa COP&rdquo; without addressing these issues and that action is urgently needly.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;It starts with setting out a clear vision around how the world is actually going to step up and provide support to those communities on the frontline,&rdquo; she underscored.</p>\n<p>\n\tEddy Perez, International Climate Diplomacy Director representing CAN Canada, explained that they know that there are obstacles ahead, but that it is imperative to reach a decision on finance in this &ldquo;climate justice COP&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The unity of the G77 [developing countries negotiating bloc] is strong, sending one single message: &lsquo;We need to leave this COP27 with the adoption of a loss and damage fund.&rsquo; The developed countries who have come here with a very cheap offer are actually looking forward to outcomes [that are merely procedural]. That would be a devastating outcome for COP27,&rdquo; he warned.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe all must do more to avert &lsquo;climate hell&rsquo;, says Biden</p>\n<p>\n\tAddressing the COP27 plenary, President Joe Biden said of the United States: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re racing forward to do our part to avert the climate hell that the UN Secretary-General so passionately warned about earlier this week.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Biden said that he had come into office determined to &ldquo;to reestablish the United States as a trustworthy and committee global leader on climate. As I stand here before you, we&rsquo;ve taken enormous strides to achieve that.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tHaving missed the opening of this year&rsquo;s climate summit due to mid-term elections in the US, Mr. Biden said his country is back as a global leader on climate, especially in the wake of the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which included some $370 billion in clean energy incentives and other actions to cut greenhouse emissions.</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile the President Biden pledged to meet the stated climate goals of the US by 2030, many of the civil society participants and activists in attendance voiced their disappointment and disapproval that he had not mentioned the issue of loss and damage funds available to vulnerable countries already being impacted by climate change.</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\t&ldquo;But as our human family grows larger, it is also growing more divided&rdquo;, warned Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres in an editorial penned ahead of the milestone moment, citing billions struggling, hundreds of millions facing hunger, and record numbers fleeing home for relief from debt, hardship, wars and climate disasters.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Unless we bridge the yawning chasm between the global haves and have-nots, we are setting ourselves up for an 8-billion-strong world filled with tensions and mistrust, crisis and conflict&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Turbocharging inequalities</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHe noted that just a handful of billionaires control as much wealth as the poorest half of the world while the top one per cent pocket one-fifth of the world&rsquo;s income.</p>\n<p>\n\tCitizens of the richest countries can expect to live up to 30 years longer than those in the poorest.</p>\n<p>\n\tTurning to the accelerating climate crisis and unequal COVID recovery, Mr. Guterres observed that &ldquo;as the world has grown richer and healthier in recent decades, these inequalities have grown too&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We are heading straight for climate catastrophe, while emissions and temperatures continue to rise. Floods, storms and droughts are devastating countries that contributed almost nothing to global heating&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, from nuclear disarmament to terrorism and global health, delays and deadlock on a host of issues is triggering &ldquo;anger and resentment against developed countries&rdquo; to a breaking point, Mr. Guterres cautioned.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We must curb these damaging trends, repair relationships and find joint solutions to our common challenges&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Stem &lsquo;runaway inequality&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tReminding that &ldquo;runaway inequality is a choice&rdquo;, the UN chief put the onus on developed countries to use the ongoing UN COP27 climate conference in Egypt and the G20 summit in Bali next Tuesday, to make a switch.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I hope COP27 will see a historic Climate Solidarity Pact under which developed and emerging economies unite around a common strategy and combine their capacities and resources for the benefit of humankind&rdquo;, he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Guterres said &ldquo;our only hope&rdquo; lies in wealthier countries providing key emerging economies with financial and technical support to transition away from fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also urged leaders to agree on a roadmap and institutional framework to compensate countries in the Global South for climate-related loss and damage that are already causing enormous suffering.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnd he maintained that a stimulus package can be adopted during the G20 meeting to provide those governments with debt relief and restructuring.</p>\n<p>\n\tAmidst the challenges, &ldquo;our eight-billion-strong world could yield</p>\n<p>\n\tenormous opportunities for some of the poorest countries, where population growth is highest&rdquo;, he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith relatively small investments in healthcare, education, gender equality and sustainable economic development, today&rsquo;s poorest countries could become engines of sustainable, green growth and prosperity, he argues.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This month&rsquo;s big global meetups must be an opportunity to start bridging divides and restoring trust, based on the equal rights and freedoms of every single member of humanity&rsquo;s eight-billion-strong family&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Eight-billion strong</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAt the same time, the UN Population Fund&rsquo;s (UNFPA) #8BillionStrong campaign marks the milestone by sharing educational material on eight trends for a world of eight billion people.</p>\n<p>\n\tThese involve slowing growth, fewer children, longer lives, people on the move, ageing populations, women outliving men, two pandemics and shifting centres.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN agency pointed out that as region are growing at different rates, the geographical distribution of the global population is shifting.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs of this year, over half the world&rsquo;s people live in Asia, with India and China making up most of the population in eastern and southeastern Asia &ndash; home to 2.3 billion people.4</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tOver 50 activists of all ages and backgrounds took over the so-called &lsquo;Blue Zone&rsquo; &ndash; the main area of the conference centre in Sharm el-Sheikh overseen by the UN &ndash; to chant &ldquo;Stop funding fossil fuels! Stop funding death!&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tSusan Huang, representing the NGO Oil Change International, was among the participants aiming to shed light on the fact that wealthy countries, as noted by the UN Secretary-General earlier this week, are still pouring money into fossil fuels at a time when we need an urgent transition to renewable energy.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;At the G7 summit last year, there was an agreement to end public finance for fossil fuels by the end of this year. But the International Energy Agency has come out and said that actually the slow transition to renewables is what is exacerbating the climate crisis and the energy crisis. So, we&rsquo;re urging world leaders to fulfil their commitment and stop public finance for fossil fuels,&rdquo; she told UN News.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Huang said that these investments are also causing incredible damage, destroying biodiversity and devastating livelihoods across the world, and she was not alone: Dipti Bhatnagar, from Friends of the Earth International in Mozambique, delivered an impassioned speech that, if the nodding heads and enthusiastic murmurs of agreement were any indication, clearly resonated among all those entering the main square of the conference centre.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Rich countries are out to grab the huge gas reserves, and people are being dispossessed of their land. One million people out of the 23 million [of Mozambique&rsquo;s] population are living in refugee camps because of gas. We say no to more gas finance. We won&rsquo;t let Africa burn,&rdquo; she shouted.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe activists made clear that the best way to increase energy access worldwide and meet the needs of the most vulnerable is by investing in community-supported renewable energy plans.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Energy plans that can be controlled and operated by the people in the community,&rdquo; Ms. Huang explained.</p>\n<p>\n\tA new AI tool to hold polluters accountable</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, just two pavilion zones away, the UN Secretary-General also called out Governments and the big banks for continuing to invest in fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>\n\tAnt&oacute;nio Guterres was speaking at the launch of a new independent inventory of greenhouse gas emissions created by the Climate TRACE Coalition and spearheaded by former US Vice-President Al Gore.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe tool combines satellite data and artificial intelligence to show the facility-level emissions of over 70,000 sites around the world, including companies in China, US and India. This will allow leaders to know the location and scope of emissions being released.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Guterres explained that the data released by the initiative shows that because methane leaks, flaring, and other activities associated with oil and gas production are underreported, emissions are many times higher than previously thought.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;This should be a wake-up call to Governments and the financial sector, especially those that continue to invest in and underwrite fossil fuel pollution,&rdquo; he told the COP27 plenary.</p>\n<p>\n\tCostly disasters</p>\n<p>\n\tThe presentation of the unprecedented interactive inventory, now online, saw Al Gore running around with a clicker, scrolling through slide after slide of climate-fuelled destruction.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe renowned author of An Inconvenient Truth, known for being one of the early advocates for climate action, played the video of an atomic bomb exploding on the massive 360 screens around the plenary. The booming sound left attendants perplexed, but curious.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe was aiming to spotlight a fact he shared earlier at the opening of the COP27 World Leaders Summit: greenhouse gas pollution accumulated in our atmosphere traps as much extra heat as 600,000 atomic bombs exploding every day.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Two months ago in September, at the UN General Assembly, the Secretary-General told us about the heat waves in Europe, the floods in Pakistan, the severe droughts&hellip; and he linked it all correctly as the price of humanity&#39;s fossil fuel addiction,&rdquo; he reminded delegates.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Gore said that these catastrophes are currently costing the global economy two and a half trillion dollars annually.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, he said, the world is at a turning point because solutions exist to reverse this dire trend, particularly by boosting investment in renewables.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe importance of the new tool</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Gore went on to note that while the financing and subsidies for fossil fuels is &ldquo;insane&rdquo;, the potential of funding for renewable energy in Africa is being overlooked.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The potential for wind and solar is 400 times larger than Africa&rsquo;s total fossil fuel reserves and it comes pollution-free and creates more jobs, but there is finance gap&hellip;That is why there is so much attention at this COP to changing the global capital allocation system,&rdquo; he emphasized.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe then explained that the Climate TRACE inventory, which combines reliable and verified data from over 100 institutions and 30,000 sensors, can help governments target their actions.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;It makes it impossible for the emitters to cheat,&rdquo; he explained and revealed that currently, the top 14 individual sources of emission in the world are all oil and gas fields.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;One of the most striking early insights from this work is the scale of emissions from oil and gas production &ndash; particularly those that have not previously been reported,&rdquo; Mr. Guterres added, calling the data a &ldquo;critical source&rdquo; of information in the effort to tackle the climate emergency.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN Secretary-General underscored that the new tool will be crucial for business leaders working to decarbonize their supply chains, for governments working to align policymaking with their climate plans, and for investors working to track private sector progress toward net zero.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The problem is even greater than we were led to believe and that means we must work even harder to accelerate the phase-out of all fossil fuels&rdquo;, he warned.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore COP finance highlights</p>\n<p>\n\tFinance day at COP27 highlighted that trillions of dollars&rsquo; worth of investments are needed each year to achieve the rapid, far-reaching transformations required to address the impact of the climate crisis, and to deliver on the objectives of the Paris Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn various conference rooms, pavilions and &lsquo;action hubs&rsquo;, and in closed-door negotiations, delegates, activists, investment bankers, and other stakeholders discussed the importance of closing the current finance gap in critical areas of climate action such as mitigation of emissions, adaptation and loss and damage.</p>\n<p>\n\tExperts agreed that the financial push must come from all sectors, public or private, debt or equity, commercial or philanthropic.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Finance is the biggest solution that can propel action everywhere&rdquo;, Anjali Viswamohanan, policy director at the Asia Investor Group, told UN News.</p>\n<p>\n\tOne of the big calls was to close the &ldquo;adaptation gap&rdquo;. According to UN Climate Change (UNFCCC), project developers and investors must focus on preparing and investing in projects that build resilience and protect the vulnerable from the negative impacts of climate change; to drive systemic change and innovation for carbon neutral, climate resilient transformation in the context of just transition; and to protect and restore natural capital.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore pledges and initiatives</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso on Wednesday, with a pledge of $20 million, New Zealand was added to the list, alongside Scotland, Norway, Germany, Austria, and Belgium, of those that have promised finance to the issue of loss and damage (payments to developing low-carbon-emitting countries affected by climate change disaster).</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, the United Kingdom said that it would allow payment deferrals to countries hit by climate disasters.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Africa Climate Risk Facility, an initiative of the Nairobi Declaration on Sustainable Insurance, was also launched, with signatories committing to underwrite $14 billion of cover for climate risks by 2030.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe US Climate Envoy, John Kerry, also held an event at COP27 announcing plans for companies to &ldquo;buy carbon credits&rdquo; and support countries transitioning away from coal.</p>\n<p>\n\tUnder the proposed plan, called the Energy Transition Accelerator, state bodies could earn carbon credits by reducing their emissions if they cut their use of fossil fuels and increase renewable energy use.</p>\n<p>\n\tOn that note, during a UNICEF press conference, young German activist Luisa Neubauer sent a stark message to world leaders making promises at COP27:</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come here and talk of climate action as long as you engage in any new fossil fuel infrastructure across the globe. Don&rsquo;t come here and speak of climate justice as fossil fuel funding is exploding. Don&rsquo;t come here try to explain that money might be short for adaptation and loss and damage while fossil fuel investments around the world are skyrocketing, day by day&rdquo;.</p>"

I commend Rishi Sunak&rsquo;s announcement that the United Kingdom will triple its adaptation finance by 2025, going even beyond the promised last year in Glasgow,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, Germany announced $170 million for loss and damage, and Belgium &euro; 2.5 million, specifically to Mozambique, which suffered terrible losses last year due to extreme rains.</p>\n<p>\n\tAustria also announced $50 million for loss and damage, and Scotland, which had previously pledged &pound;2 million, announced an additional &pound;5 million.</p>\n<p>\n\tSo far only five European countries &ndash; Austria, Scotland, Belgium, Denmark and Germany &ndash; have committed to address loss and damage.</p>\n<p>\n\tUrsula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, told leaders on Tuesday to follow her region&rsquo;s example of committing to climate financing to the developing world.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Those most in need in the developing world must be supported in adapting to a harsher climate. We urge our partners in the global north to stand by their climate finance commitments to the global south. Team Europe is stepping up &hellip; despite COVID, despite the Russian war&rdquo;, she said.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, small island developing states continued denouncing developed countries for not delivering their finance promises.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We will fight unrelentingly for climate justice, including in the international courts,&rdquo; warned Gaston Brown, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Adaptation in Africa</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAt a COP27 leaders&rsquo; event on accelerating adaptation in Africa, Secretary-General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres also made a call for more adaptation finance.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We need to invest massively in adaptation if we want to be able not to spend much more money in addressing the consequences of the disaster,&rdquo; adding that &ldquo;it is very clear, we need to be able to share adaptation and mitigation in climate finance&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Guterres reiterated that multilateral development banks have a huge capacity to mobilize and to leverage private finance that is not being used.</p>\n<p>\n\tNana Akufo-Addo, the President of Ghana, also at the event, said that while Africa has done the least to cause climate change, the continent&rsquo;s people, especially the youth, are suffering the worst impacts.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Support and join in the fight against climate change,&rdquo; he urged world leaders.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, in his national statement, Paul Kagame, the President of Rwanda, argued that during the COVID-19 pandemic, external financing hadn&rsquo;t worked for vulnerable nations.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The most valuable contribution that developed countries can make is to reduce their emissions faster while investing in Africa to build sustainable, green power. Questioning whether Africa is ready to make use of climate finance should not be used as an excuse to justify inaction,&rdquo; he stated.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Other highlights</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMore initiatives were launched today, including the Africa Carbon Markets initiative, which aims to expand Africa&rsquo;s participation in voluntary carbon markets by setting goals for the continent and developing a roadmap of action programmes that will be implemented over the next few years to meet those goals.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn other highlights, one small island nation demanded at COP27 an international fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty, to phase out the use of coal, oil and gas.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The warming seas are starting to swallow our lands &ndash; inch by inch. But the world&rsquo;s addiction to oil, gas and coal can&rsquo;t sink our dreams under the waves,&rdquo; Tuvalu Prime Minister Kausea Natano said.</p>\n<p>\n\tLast September, at the UN General Assembly, Vanuatu had called for the establishment of this treaty as well.</p>\n<p>\n\tLeaders from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) also made a call today for supporting developing countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Climate disasters leave a long shadow &hellip; for decades, years or even generations, and there is a growing recognition that we cannot leave vulnerable communities who have done little for this crisis to deal with these global crises on their own,&rdquo; said Theresa Anderson, Climate Policy Coordinator from NGO Action Aid during a press conference.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe highlighted that developing countries represent six out of seven people in the planet, and they are all insisting that COP27 establish a funding facility to address loss and damage.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Wealthy polluting countries need to look beyond their own noses, recognize the importance of a new financing facility that can help devasted countries to pick up the pieces and recover in the aftermath of climate disasters&rdquo;, the activist underscored.</p>"

They can&rsquo;t also participate or have their partners participate in lobbying activities against climate change or just report on one part of their business&#39;s assets while hiding the rest.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We must have zero tolerance for net-zero greenwashing. Today&rsquo;s Expert Group report is a how-to guide to ensure credible, accountable net-zero pledges,&rdquo; Ant&oacute;nio Guterres said at the launch at the report at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Guidelines and clarity for non-state actors</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tLast year at COP26 in Glasgow, Mr. Guterres announced that he would appoint an Expert Group to address a &lsquo;surplus of confusion and deficit of credibility&rsquo; over net-zero targets of non-State entities.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe group&rsquo;s first report is the result of intense work and consultations over seven months and reflects the best advice of the 17 experts selected by the UN chief.</p>\n<p>\n\tThrough 10 practical recommendations, the report provides clarity in four key areas as defined by the Secretary-General: environmental integrity; credibility; accountability; and the role of governments.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The report&rsquo;s recommendations, as explained by the UN chief</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>1. Promises cannot be a &lsquo;toxic cover-up&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the report, net-zero pledges must in line with the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios limiting warming to 1.5 degrees.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;That means global emissions must decline by at least 45 per cent by 2030 &ndash; and reach net zero by 2050.&nbsp; Pledges should have interim targets every five years starting in 2025,&rdquo; the Secretary-General explained.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe targets must also cover all greenhouse emissions and all their scopes. For financial institutions this means all of their finance activities, and for businesses and cities it means all emissions &ndash; direct, indirect and those originating from supply chains.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The message is clear to all those managing existing voluntary initiatives &ndash; as well as CEOs, mayors [and] governors committing to net-zero: Abide by this standard and update your guidelines right away &ndash; and certainly no later than COP28,&rdquo; Mr. Guterres underscored.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN chief also sent a strong message to fossil fuel companies and their &ldquo;financial enablers&rdquo; that have pledges that exclude core products and activities poisoning the planet and urged them to review their promises and align them with the report&rsquo;s guidance.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Using bogus &lsquo;net-zero&rsquo; pledges to cover up massive fossil fuel expansion is reprehensible. It is rank deception. This toxic cover-up could push our world over the climate cliff. The sham must end&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>2. Plans must be detailed and concrete</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Guterres said that net-zero pledges should be accompanied by a plan for how the transition is being made.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Management must be accountable for delivering on these pledges. This means publicly advocating for decisive climate action and disclosing all lobbying activity,&rdquo; he said, adding that the absence of standards, regulations and rigor in voluntary carbon market credits is deeply concerning.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso, the pledges must detail how the transition will address the needs of workers in fossil fuel industries and sectors affected by the renewable energy transition.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe report also provides clarity and details on what businesses, financial institutions, and sub-national authorities need to do to phase out coal, oil and gas.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>3. The promises must be accountable and transparent</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Secretary-General called on all net-zero voluntary initiatives to accelerate efforts to standardize progress reports, in an open format and via public platforms that feed the UN Climate Change&rsquo;s Global Climate Action Portal.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We must work together to fill gaps from the lack of universally recognized credible third-party authorities &ndash; and we must strengthen mechanisms positioned to conduct this verification and accountability process,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>4. Voluntary initiatives need to become a new normal</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, the UN chief said that governments need to ensure that the now voluntary initiatives become a &ldquo;new normal&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I urge all government leaders to provide non-State entities with a level playing field to transition to a just, net-zero future. Solving the climate crisis requires strong political leadership,&rdquo; he underscored, reiterating that developed countries also need to accelerate their decarbonization and lead by example.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>The voice of the experts</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe report comes in a year in which the world has been plagued by an energy crisis triggered by Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, as well as seemingly nonstop climate impacts like the unprecedented flooding in Pakistan and crippling drought in the US.</p>\n<p>\n\tCurrently over 80 per cent of global emissions are covered by net-zero pledges.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Right now, the planet cannot afford delays, excuses, or more greenwashing,&rdquo; said former Canadian Minister Catherine Mckenna, chairman of the High-Level Expert Group.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe explained that in such a crucial time, making net-zero pledges is about cutting emissions, not corners.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Mckenna congratulated some actors that are making strides, such as companies investing in innovation, investors moving their money from dirty to clean, and cities changing their energy grid to renewables.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;But the bad news is that too many of the net-zero pledges are... little more than empty slogans and hype,&rdquo; she argued. &ldquo;Why is greenwashing so bad? In part, because the stakes are so high. It&rsquo;s not just advertising, bogus net-zero claims drive up the cost that ultimately everyone would pay. Including people not in this room, through huge impact, climate migration and their very lives&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tMs. Mckenna also noted on Tuesday that French President Emmanuel Macron and UN Climate Envoy Michael Bloomberg have launched a new initiative to create a net-zero data public utility, that will provide verified data to hold companies accountable.</p>"

I will not be a custodian of back-sliding,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>An inclusive process</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn words that drew an ovation in the plenary room, the UN climate chief underscored that women and girls must be placed at the centre of climate decision-making and action.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Their empowerment leads to better governance and better outcomes,&rdquo; he said, also highlighting the importance of civil society organizations and the youth in the COP27 process.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>New Presidency</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAlok Sharma, President of COP26 representing the United Kingdom, passed the baton officially to the new Egyptian President, Sameh Shoukry, during the opening plenary.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Sharma reviewed the achievements made at Glasgow last year, such as finalising the so-called Paris Rulebook &ndash; the the guidelines for how that Agreement is delivered &ndash; and making stronger finance commitments.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The UN Secretary-General has said &lsquo;our shared long-term futures do not lie in fossil fuels&rsquo;, and I agree with him, wholeheartedly&rdquo;, he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the COP26 President, if all commitments made last year, including the net-zero pledges, were to be implemented, the world would be on a path to 1.7 degrees Celsius warming by the end of the century.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Still not 1.5C, but progress,&rdquo; he said, recognising the scale of the challenge that the world is facing.</p>\n<p>\n\tEchoing Mr. Stiell, he urged leaders to act, despite current geopolitical challenges.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;As challenging as our current moment is, inaction is myopic, and can only defer climate catastrophe, we must find the ability to focus on more than one thing at once&rdquo;, he urged.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Egypt urges implementation</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tCOP27 President Sameh Shoukry called on delegates to scale up ambition and begin implementing the promises already made.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Moving from negotiations and pledges to an era of implementation is a priority,&rdquo; he said, later commending the countries which have already shared updated national climate plans.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Shoukry added that the $100 billion promised for adaptation by developed countries to developing countries should be delivered, and finance must be also at the centre of discussion.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The negotiations [during the next two weeks] will hopefully be fruitful. I urge all of you to listen carefully and commit to implementation and to turn political commitments into agreements and understandings and texts and resolutions that we can all implement,&rdquo; he underscored.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also warned that &ldquo;zero-sum games will have no winners&rdquo; and that the implications of the negotiations will affect the lives and livelihoods of millions of people around the world suffering the impact of climate change.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We cannot afford any negligence or shortcomings; we cannot threaten the future of upcoming generations&rdquo;, he emphasised.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Loss and damage</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAlso on Sunday, the agenda items that will be discussed over the next two weeks at COP27 were agreed during the procedural opening.</p>\n<p>\n\t&lsquo;Loss and damage&rsquo;, an item that was still uncertain ahead the conference, finally made it into the agenda after being put forward by negotiators from the Group of the 77 and China (which essentially includes all developing nations) and after extensive discussions among the 194 parties to the UN Climate Convention.</p>\n<p>\n\tClimate change, through extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, desertification and rising sea levels, causes costly damage to countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tBecause the intensification of these otherwise &ldquo;natural disasters&rdquo; is being caused by the rise in greenhouse gas emissions, mostly from rich industrialized countries, developing countries &ndash; often the most affected &ndash; have long argued that they should receive compensation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe issue of these payments, known as &ldquo;loss and damage&rdquo; now will be a major topic of discussion at COP27.</p>"

The rate of ocean warming has been exceptionally high over the past two decades; marine heatwaves are becoming more frequent, and warming rates are expected to continue in the future.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe study details the effects of both droughts and excessive rains. Kenya, Somalia, and Ethiopia are facing crop failure and food insecurity, because of another season of below-average rains, whilst more than a third of Pakistan was flooded in July and August, as a result of record-breaking rain, displacing almost eight million people.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe southern Africa region was battered by a series of cyclones over two months at the start of the year, hitting Madagascar hardest with torrential rain and devastating floods, and in September, Hurricane Ian caused extensive damage and loss of life in Cuba and southwest Florida.</p>\n<p>\n\tLarge parts of Europe sweltered in repeated episodes of extreme heat: the United Kingdom saw a new national record on 19 July, when the temperature topped more than 40&deg;C for the first time.

However, by mid-century, that number will likely soar to 201 days.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Energy impacts</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tElectricity availability and fuels used to generate it to power air conditioners and heaters, play a crucial role in our ability to cope with extreme temperatures, said UNDP.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe impact of climate change differs across sectors of the economy &ndash; Human Climate Horizons</p>\n<p>\n\tYet, the impacts of climate change on energy use will vary locally, as individuals, communities and businesses adapt to conditions using available resources.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Jakarta, for example, electricity consumption in response to warmer temperatures is projected to increase by roughly one-third of current household consumption in Indonesia. This will require critical additional infrastructure planning.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Labour impacts</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMore frequent and severe temperature extremes also impact livelihoods, affecting the ability to perform tasks and influencing work intensity and duration.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The impact of climate change differs across sectors of the economy with workers in high-risk, weather-exposed industries like agriculture, construction, mining and manufacturing most affected&rdquo;, according to platform data.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Niamey, Niger, in sectors such as construction, mining and manufacturing, excessive heat was responsible for 36 fewer working hours annually, taking a 2.5 per cent toll on the country&rsquo;s future GDP.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Human consequences</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAs the impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed globally, they will generate a significant uptick in inequalities over the coming years and decades.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut by highlighting that the future is not predetermined, UNDP hopes the information can empower people everywhere, to step up climate action.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Human Climate Horizons mission is to ensure equal access to data on future impacts, inform decision-making and help everyone understand the human consequences of climate change in different scenarios.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;Logical economic choice&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, UNDP has also launched the How Just Transition Can Deliver the Paris Agreement report this week, highlighting the need to embrace the &ldquo;green revolution&rdquo; &ndash; or risk increasing social inequality, civil unrest, economic loss.</p>\n<p>\n\tAhead of the UN climate conference, COP27, which kicks off on Sunday in in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the report spotlights the importance of &ldquo;fair and equitable&rdquo; transitioning to meeting the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom providing workers with new green economy skills and access to social protection to ensuring that countries lay out a clear pathway to a net-zero future, UNDP chief Achim Steiner said the report provides &ldquo;real-world insights into how to accelerate momentum around a just transition that is fair and equitable for the energy sector and beyond&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A just transition</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe report analyses both enhanced short-term climate pledges, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and long-term strategies in which countries lay out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero.</p>\n<p>\n\tEncouragingly, 72 per cent of nations with enhanced NDCs that refer to a just transition are linking them to socio-economic considerations, while 66 per cent are proposing concrete actions and measures factoring in climate justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, they fail to make linkages to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or gender equality in either short or long-term climate plans &ndash; missing a significant opportunity, UNDP said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;As climate change intensifies and the world faces an immense energy crunch&hellip;decoupling from fossil fuels and investing in the green energy infrastructure of tomorrow&hellip;[is] the only logical economic choice&rdquo;, said Mr. Steiner.</p>"
