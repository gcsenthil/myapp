Out of which 120 Mn, almost one-fourth, are paying users, according to the report, which Lumikai said is the most comprehensive ever undertaken across India&rsquo;s gaming industry.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tIn FY22, mid-core games (like BGMI, and Free Fire) were the fastest growing gaming category achieving growth of 32 percent, grossing combined revenues of approximately $550 million.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Indians pay for games. Nearly 48 percent of gamers spend money on mid-core games. As may as 65 percent of paying gamers claim they have engaged in in-app purchases at least once.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Indian gaming companies are on track to raise $513 million for the calendar year &rsquo;22. Gaming sector funding is up 380 percent from 2019 and up by 23 percent from 2020.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tWeb3 emerged as an increasingly popular technology in games, with 30 percent of 450 Indian Web3 companies operating in gaming. Web3 games in India have raised nearly USD 400 million in funding (2019-22).</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>India-based content is growing in popularity with 80 percent of gamers showing a proclivity to play games based on Indian intellectual property.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The number of female gamers in India is on the rise. Male: female ratio of surveyed gamers yielded a 60:40 ratio, equally split between metro and nonmetro cities, accordig to the Lumikai report.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tSharing his thoughts on the report, Justin Shriram Keeling, Founding General Partner, Lumikai said, &ldquo;India&rsquo;s gaming industry this year hit major inflection points, registering strong growth across the board. India crossed half a billion gamers in FY22, up from 450 Mn the year prior. &quot;</p>\n<p>\n\tIndustry growth is expected to be fuelled by a rapidly increasing gamer base, higher conversion to paid users,<br />\n\tand increasing sophistication of Indian gamers.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;With the market now truly mainstream, we are thrilled to be at the forefront of investing in one of the fastest growing and most dynamic sectors in digital India,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Commenting on the state of the gaming ecosystem in India, Salone Sehgal, Founding General Partner, Lumikai said, &quot;The last 28 months have been watershed years in terms of attracting VC investment of over $2.6Bn in the Indian gaming landscape. Sustained capital investment and liquidity outcomes in the form of strategic exits valuing $750M+, multiple unicorns, and a publicly traded company have heightened the interests of entrepreneurs and investors alike.&quot;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThis sustained momentum should further drive entrepreneurial ambition and innovation in the Indian gaming<br />\n\tindustry, he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe report projects the Indian gaming market would reach $8.6Bn by 2027.</p>"

The Bank doesn&rsquo;t want to slow the economy too much with its interventions.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tHigher interest rates will mean higher repayments on things like mortgages, credit cards and car loans - increasing the financial pressure on lots of households.</p>\n<p>\n\tA hike in interest rates will drive more workers into debt and other forms of financial hardship, a major trade union has warned, the BBC report said.</p>\n<p>\n\tA survey of 6,000 people on behalf of Unite has revealed that more than half cannot or will have difficulty paying their bills this year.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe union&#39;s general secretary Sharon Graham says their research shows many workers &quot;face unsurmountable financial pressure&quot;.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe poll also suggests more than two thirds of workers have experienced a real-terms pay cut this year (when their wages are rising at below the rate of prices).</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Graham went on to argue that the problem which is driving inflation is not worker&#39;s wage demands, but rather &quot;corporate greed&quot;, the BBC added.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tRenters could find it more difficult to find properties in the next year or two as landlords struggle with higher mortgage rates, an expert told MPs on Wednesday.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>About 40 percent of landlords have a mortgage on their rental properties.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe BBC report quoted Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, as saying that the Bank of England is &quot;likely to be divided&quot;, with some policymakers on its Monetary Policy Committee pushing for a smaller increase in the base rate of 0.5 percentage points.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&quot;The size of the increase will signal how concerned Bank of England policymakers are about inflation versus a recession as it looks to curtail further price rises without inadvertently causing unnecessary economic pain,&quot; she said.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tShe pointed out that the mortgage market has calmed down since former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng&#39;s mini-budget and the U-turns that followed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>But she also added that about two million borrowers on variable rate mortgages look set to face increased payments after Thursday&#39;s decision.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe war in Ukraine and the long recovery from the pandemic have also contributed to rising energy and food costs.</p>"

However, sequentially quarter-over-quarter, edible oil grew by 17% in volumes, suggesting an uptick in demand in Q2FY23.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Company witnessed multiple headwinds on the margin front, with the high volatility in edible oil prices, allotment of lower TRQ (Tariff Rate Quota) and inflation impact on our operating expenses.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Company grew YoY by 9% in volumes and 4% in revenue in Q2FY23.</p>\n<p>\n\tA significant contribution came from Food &amp; FMCG as well as Industry Essentials, which grew robustly at 41% and 22% y-o-y, respectively &ndash; thereby driving larger diversification in the revenue base and strengthening the platform for multiple business growth drivers for the future.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Key Highlights:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Relaunch of Kohinoor and other brands in the Rice segment:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tPost the acquisition of Kohinoor brand in May 2022, the company relaunched the entire product range to the markets in August 2022.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe company is optimistic on the prospects of market share gains in the rice business with the strategy of addressing the premium consumer segment through Kohinoor brand and mass segment through brand Charminar, and penetrating the HoReCa segment through the Trophy brand.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Market Share: (Nielsen MAT September 2022)</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMarket share in Edible Oil grew by 30 basis points to 18.5% on a standalone basis and 19.5% on a consolidated basis.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Fortune Atta</strong> continued to gain market share reaching 4.9% share as against 3.9% in the same quarter last year;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Fortune Basmati</strong> and Kohinoor now has a combined market share of 10%, with Fortune share growing from 5.1% to 8.5%.</p>\n<p>\n\tWith the recent relaunch of Kohinoor brand in the market, company expects further gains in market share.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Profitability:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe quarter witnessed multiple headwinds in the edible oil segment.</p>\n<p>\n\tDue to macro factors affecting the demand-supply situation in edible oils, there was a steep decline in prices of palm oil, soyabean oil and sunflower during the quarter.<br />\n\tSharp fall in prices left most of the players with high price inventory in hand.<br />\n\tThe company also passed on the benefit of lower prices to the consumers.<br />\n\tThis coupled with currency depreciation impacted margins during the quarter.<br />\n\tHowever, this is purely cyclical in nature and on account of events that the industry witnessed in the quarter.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe tariff rate quota (TRQ) announced by the government in July 2022 was a step towards controlling inflation.<br />\n\tWhile this was a welcome move for the industry and consumers, it put the company into a disadvantageous position, given that the quota share allocated to us was lower than both our market share and manufacturing capacity.<br />\n\tAs a result, cost of sourcing of soyabean oil for us was higher than the competition leading to a disparity in the business.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe inflation impact on operating cost added further pressure on margins in Q2FY23.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Near-term Outlook:</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSeptember 2022 witnessed higher edible oil imports of 1.59 MMT against 1.37 MMT in August 2022, the company said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;We see positive signs of recovery going forward in edible oils business for H2FY23, with softening of commodity prices and the recent uptick in demand on the back of festivities and weddings, it added.</p>"

The order will come into effect immediately.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn view of the restoration of ample supplies and the continuous decline in the prices of edible oils both in the international as well as the domestic market, it was an opportune time for the exemption of wholesalers and Bulk consumers (big chain retailers shops) from the stock limit control order.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe removal will also have a positive effect on the oilseed prices as it will boost procurement of the oilseeds hereby increasing the returns of domestic oilseeds-growing farmers, it added.</p>"

The possibilities of using weaponized drones for terrorist purposes against strategic, infrastructure and commercial assets call for serious attention by the member states, he added.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDr Jaishankar said Indias own experience of the 2008 Mumbai attacks showed that how a benign technology of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) could be used for organizing and directing such a barbaric terrorist attack from beyond the borders.</p>\n<p>\n\tMore recently, these terrorist groups have been using unmanned aerial platforms, such as drones and quadcopters for cross border trafficking of drugs and arms and for carrying out terrorist attacks, he said.</p>"

This a huge change from the days when it was expected that poor will go to the bank to a scenario when the banks were going on the doorstep of the poor. This involved reduction of distance between the poor and the banks. “We not only removed the physical distance but, most importantly, we removed the psychological distance.&quot </p><p>The highest priority was given to covering far-flung areas with banking.</p> <p>The Prime Minister informed that today more than 99 per cent of villages in India have a bank branch, banking outlet or a &quot banking mitra &quot within a 5 km radius.</p> <p>&quotExtensive Post Office network too was harnessed via India Post Banks for providing the banking needs to the common citizens&quot, he said.</p> <p>&quotToday the number of branches per one lakh adult citizens in India is more than countries like Germany, China and South Africa,&quot he added.</p><p><blockquote class=&quottwitter-tweet&quot><p lang=&quoten&quot dir=&quotltr&quot>Today, 75 Digital Banking Units are being launched across India.

These accounts were the key modality for providing homes, toilets, gas subsidy, and benefits of schemes for farmers could be ensured seamlessly,&quot he said.</p><p>The Prime Minister acknowledged the global recognition for India’s digital banking infrastructure.</p><p>&quotThe IMF has praised India's digital banking infrastructure. The credit for this goes to the poor, farmers and labourers of India, who have adopted new technologies, made it a part of their lives,&quot he emphasised.</p><p>&quotUPI has opened up new possibilities for India,&quot the Prime Minister continued, &quotWhen financial partnerships are combined with digital partnerships, a whole new world of possibilities opens up. A huge example of UPI is before us. India is proud of this as it is the first technology of its kind in the world.&quot,</p><p>He informed that today 70 crore indigenous Rupay cards are in operation, a vast change from the days of foreign players and the elite nature of such products.</p><p>&quotThis combination of technology and economy is enhancing the dignity and affordability for the poor and empowering the middle class, while at the same time it is also eliminating the digital divide of the country,&quot he said.</p><p>PM Modi also praised the role of DBT in eliminating corruption and said that more than 25 lakh crore rupees have been transferred in various schemes via DBT. He informed me that he will transfer the next instalment to the farmers tomorrow.</p><p>&quotToday the whole world is appreciating this DBT and the digital power of India. Today it is being seen as a global model. The World Bank has even gone so far as to say that India has become a leader in ensuring social security through digitization,&quot said the Prime Minister.</p><p>The Prime Minister informed that fintech is at the heart of India's policies and efforts, and it is playing a key role in shaping the future. Digital banking units will further expand this capability of fintech.</p><p>&quotIf Jan Dhan accounts had laid the foundation of financial inclusion in the country, then Fintech would form the basis of a financial revolution,&quot he said.</p><p>Referring to the government’s announcement of the launch of a digital currency based on blockchain technology, the Prime Minister pointed out that: &quotBe it digital currency in the coming times, or digital transactions in today's time, apart from the economy, many important aspects are associated with them.&quot </p><p>He listed the savings, elimination of the hassle of physical currency and environmental benefits as key advantages.</p><p>The Prime Minister pointed out that paper and ink for currency printing are imported, and by adopting a digital economy we are contributing to a self-reliant India while also benefiting the environment by reducing the consumption of paper.</p>"

The Vice-President of the Republic of Mauritius, Eddy Boiss&eacute;zon; members of Cabinet and of the National Assembly; representatives of the Diplomatic Corps, including the High Commissioner of the Republic of India, K. Nandini Singla; and other eminent personalities attended the commemorative activity.</p>\n<p>\n\t&quot;The event comprised a wreath-laying ceremony by the Prime Minister and other dignitaries; cultural and artistic items highlighting the historical legacy of the Indentured Labourers; and the launching of the annual Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund magazine,&quot; read a statement issued by the Mauritius government.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>In his keynote speech, the Prime Minister saluted the courage, perseverance, sufferings, sacrifices, efforts, resilience and patience of the Indentured Labourers, underlining their immense contributions to the socioeconomic development of the Republic of Mauritius.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Head of Government recalled that some 462,000 immigrants came to Mauritius from India between 1834 and 1920, seeking a better life, and had, upon their arrival, faced tough challenges and appalling conditions that denied them their humanity.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe talked, too, of the significance of the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site, where 188 years ago, some 36 Indian immigrants, after their journey on board the M.V. Atlas, climbed the flights of 16 steps with the objective of creating a future for themselves and their children.</p>\n<p>\n\tAccording to the Prime Minister, the history of indentured workers was one of the most inspirational chapters of Mauritian history.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe, thus, stressed the imperative for the population, in general, and the young generations, in particular, to learn their common history and of the life of their forebears, and to visit the historical sites across the island.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>Jugnauth put forward the harsh experiences of the previous generations who struggled, sweated and toiled with great dignity, and succeeded, against all odds, in paving the way for the development and prosperity of the country.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Our story is the continuation of their history,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister also honoured all the historical figures who fought throughout decades for the human, social, political, religious and cultural rights of all to be recognised and respected.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe moreover paid tribute to the people who were instrumental in the preservation of the historical legacy and site, namely the contribution of late Dr Corrine Forrest in the Aapravasi Ghat Trust Fund and in the promotion of the Aapravasi Ghat World Heritage Site.</p>\n<p>\n\tFurthermore, the population was invited by Mr Jugnauth to work together and to persevere in building unity amidst the diversity and multicultural aspects that were the hallmarks of the Mauritian nation.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister urged everyone to live in peace and harmony, while being proud of their ancestors and remembering the past.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs for the Minister of Arts and Cultural Heritage, Mr Avinash Teeluck, he invited the audience to cast their mind back to the time of the arrival of the first Indentured Labourers, and to reflect on their living and working conditions.</p>\n<p>\n\tTeeluck spoke as well of the wreath laying ceremony that was held on 1st November 2022 at Antoinette Phooliyar in Barlow where the first 36 Indian Immigrants lived after their arrival in Mauritius.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>The Minister announced that an indentured village would be constructed at Antoinette Phooliyar in Barlow to present a living picture of the indentured experience. He indicated that thorough research had been undertaken and was ongoing to deliver a factual rendition of life and circumstances at that time.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tFor her part, the High Commissioner of the Republic of India dwelt upon the prominent and active role of the Indian Diaspora in the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tShe affirmed that Mauritius epitomised the spirit of the Pravasi Bhartiya Divas, and seized the opportunity to invite people from Mauritius to participate in the 17th Pravasi Bhartiya Divas which would be hosted in Indore, Madhya Pradesh, in India, in January 2023. The Pravasi Bhartiya Divas is celebrated on 09 January, to commemorate the date of the return of Mahatma Gandhi from South Africa to India in 1915 and highlight the contribution of the overseas Indian community to the development of India.</p>",

        "content": "<p>\n\tThe Commission had received a complaint of an international trafficking racket from seven women belonging to Uzbekistan.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey had alleged that they were brought to India on the pretext of providing jobs, but when they arrived here, they were forced into prostitution and sexual slavery.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey informed that some of them were brought to Delhi via Nepal and some directly to India on tourist visa and medical visa at different times, DCW stated in a statement.</p>\n<p>\n\tThey alleged that those who were brought via Nepal, their passports and other documents were snatched away in Nepal itself and then they were brought to Delhi, while other women who were brought to Delhi on medical visa, their passport and other documents were taken away by the traffickers after arriving in India, the statement stated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>DCW Chief Swati Maliwal said, &ldquo;Seven Uzbek girls had exposed international racket involving trafficking and sex slavery. Delhi Police registered an FIR, but all accused persons were not arrested and the girls&rsquo; passports were not recovered from the traffickers.&rdquo;</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>&ldquo;I am concerned that the traffickers may have orchestrated this since all of them are yet to be arrested. I have issued summons to Delhi Police. I want them to produce these five girls before the commission, ensure arrests of all traffickers and recover the girls&rsquo; passports. Strongest action should be taken against such international sex rackets operating in the Capital,&rdquo; said Maliwal.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Commission issued a notice to Delhi Police in the matter who informed that an FIR under relevant sections of IPC was registered at Chanakyapuri Police Station and three accused were also arrested. However, the women had named 10 accused and 7 of them were yet to be arrested.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe victims desperately needed their documents to go back to their country, but Delhi police were unable to arrange the same.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlso, the women were sent to a shelter home where they were residing since then. Now, the Commission has learnt that five women have been missing from the shelter home since the past few days, it stated.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Commission has asked the police the reasons why their identity documents including passports could not be released from the clutches of the traffickers and returned to the women.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<strong>DCW also issued a notice to the private shelter home to understand the circumstances under which the women have gone missing from there.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, Delhi Police officials said that they received the summons issued from DCW on November 1, where in New Delhi district police have been asked to submit a reply and appear before the Commission on November 4.</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tAddressing the gathering, the Prime Minister said that today is a big day for hundreds of families of Delhi as it is a new beginning for many jhuggi dwelling poor families.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister informed that more than 3000 homes have already been prepared in the first phase of Kalkaji Extension alone. Very soon, other families living in the area will get the opportunity to enter their new homes.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I am sure that these efforts of the central government will play a big role in making Delhi an ideal city,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tRemarking on the development that is witnessed and the dreams that are realised in big cities like Delhi, the Prime Minister said that the foundation of such developments and dreams is made up of the hard work and efforts of the poor.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>&ldquo;Paradoxically&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;these poor people have been made to live in deplorable conditions. When there is such an imbalance in one single city, who can we think of holistic development? In the Azadi ka Amrit Kaal, we have to fill this huge gap. That is why, the country is moving on the path of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas for everyone&rsquo;s upliftment.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister pointed out that for decades, the system of governance in the country was plagued with the mentality that poverty is a poor people&rsquo;s issue but the government of today belongs to the poor and it is not in its nature to leave them be.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe highlighted that the poor remain central to policy formation and decision-making systems and that the government is treating the issues of the urban poor with equal importance.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister said that there were 50 lakh people in Delhi, who did not even have a bank account.</p>\n<p>\n\tThat deprived them of any benefit of the banking system.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;They were in Delhi but Delhi was very far from them,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis situation was changed by the government and a campaign for financial inclusion via opening accounts was undertaken. This resulted in direct benefits to the poor people of Delhi, including street vendors.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also commented on the ubiquitous penetration of UPI. More than 50 thousand street vendors received financial assistance under the SVANidhi scheme.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>The Prime Minister said, &ldquo;We are ensuring &#39;Ease of Living&#39; for the poor in Delhi through &#39;One Nation, One Ration Card&#39;.&rdquo;</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThis proved hugely beneficial for poor segments during the pandemic. Lakhs of eligible vulnerable people are receiving free ration from the central government for the last two years. In Delhi only, more than 2.5 thousand crore Rupees were spent on this, he informed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister continued and informed that more than 40 lakh poor people in Delhi got the security of insurance. Medical expenses were brought down through Jan Aushadhi Schemes.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;When there is this security in life, the poor work hard with all their might without rest. He works to lift himself out of poverty,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister said that all this is done with much fanfare and expansive advertisements.</p>\n<p>\n\tThis is because &ldquo;we live to bring change in your lives,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking on the topic of unauthorised colonies in Delhi the Prime Minister acknowledged the constant worry of the people about the status of their houses.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The central government has also done the work of reducing this concern of the people of Delhi. Work is going on to regularise the houses built in unauthorised colonies of Delhi through the PM-UDAY scheme. Till now thousands of people have taken advantage of this scheme,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also mentioned that 700 crore rupees have been spent in providing interest subsidies to poor and middle-class families for constructing their own houses.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Our government is leaving no stone unturned to fulfil the aspirations of citizens in Delhi. The aim of the central government is to turn Delhi into a grand city complete with all amenities in accordance with its status as the capital of the country,&quot; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tReferring to his talk of &lsquo;aspirational society&rsquo; from the ramparts of Red Fort, the Prime Minister said Delhi&rsquo;s poor and middle class is both aspirational and talented.</p>\n<p>\n\tEmphasising the development in the Delhi NCR region, the Prime Minister informed about the expansion of metro routes from 190 km to 400 km after 2014.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe further noted that in the last 8 years, 135 new metro stations have been added to the network which ended up saving time and money. The Prime Minister also informed that the Government of India with an investment of Rs. 50 thousand crores is widening roads to provide relief to Delhi from traffic congestion.</p>\n<blockquote>\n\t<p>\n\t\t<span style=\"font-size:16px;\"><strong>The Prime Minister gave examples of Dwarka Expressway, Urban Extension Road, Akshardham to Baghpat 6-lane Access Control Highway and elevated corridor in the form of Gurugram-Sohna Road.</strong></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister informed that services like Rapid Rail for Delhi NCR are going to begin in the near future.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe noted the grand construction of the New Delhi Railway Station that is going to take place and expressed delight at the construction of Bharat Vandana Park on 80 hectares of land in Dwarka which is now moving towards completion in the next few months.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I am told that over 700 big parks in Delhi are maintained by the DDA. Various parks are being developed by DDA on the 22 km stretch between Wazirabad barrage to Okhla barrage,&rdquo; he informed.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Prime Minister asked the beneficiaries of the new houses to use LED bulbs only to save electricity, to make sure no water gets wasted and most importantly to keep the entire colony clean and beautiful.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe noted that today the government of India is building houses for crores of poor people, supplying water through taps, providing electricity connections, Ujjwala cylinders, and so we have to break the age-old misconception that slums are associated with filth.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;I am sure everyone will continue to play a leading role in the development of Delhi and the country. With the contribution of every citizen, the journey of Delhi and India&rsquo;s development will reach new heights&rdquo;, the Prime Minister concluded.</p>",

Sangwan, who replaced Narayan Das in the first half, sent in a corner at the near post. Vafa, using his physicality, bulldozed past his marker and met the ball with a beautiful header that found the back of the net.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, the Iranian saw his second yellow card of the match in the very next minute and was sent off because of his celebrations.</p>\n<p>\n\tEast Bengal, though, couldn&rsquo;t take numerical advantage of the situation as Golui also saw his second yellow of the game in the 74th minute when he elbowed Thapa&#39;s face.</p>\n<p>\n\tChennaiyin held firm for the remaining 15 minutes to take home three full points and notch up their second win of the campaign.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Marina Machans next face Mumbai City at home on November 12.</p>"

Shadab Khan prized out Milton Shumba before Sean Williams and Sikandar Raza went about the resurrection work.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tThings turned south pretty quickly when Shadab sent back Williams and Chakabva off successive deliveries, the latter dismissed off a spectacular grab at first slip by Babar Azam.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tShadab completed a brilliant spell of 4-0-23-3 but there was more in store for Zimbabwe from the other end.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn the very next over after losing two wickets off back-to-back balls to Shadab, Zimbabwe lost a further two as Mohammad Wasim dismissed Raza and Luke Jongwe off successive balls.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom 95/3, and what appeared to be a solid start, quickly turned into 95/7 as Pakistans bowlers went on a rampage in Perth.</p>\n<p>\n\tEventually, they put up 130/8 on board with some help from Brad Evans down the order.</p>\n<p>\n\tIt seemed unlikely to be enough but a superb bowling display from Zimbabwe ensured otherwise.</p>"

There are so many things involved in hosting a FIFA event--there are technical conducts, event management, one has to take care of protocols ranging from security to accreditations and power back-ups and so many things. But we have managed to do it successfully.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tFor the U-17 World Cup, we had the main stadium and another five training sites which were developed, including the main pitch of the Kalinga Stadium, all according to FIFA standards, Krishna informed.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tOver Rs 70 crores were spent for preparing the infrastructure for the World Cup.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tIt included five football pitches  the main stadium and four practice pitches (Police Battalion Ground 1, Ground 2, the Capital High School Ground and another artificial turf in Unit 1).</p>\n\n<p>\n\tAnd not that everything went off smoothly, there were unexpected hitches and challenges but that didnt deter Krishna and his staff.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tDuring the pandemic, as the nation came to a standstill, the progress of work for the U-17 World Cup got badly hit.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tDuring the Covid-19 time, we were supposed to construct one artificial turf and that got delayed for obvious reasons. The import of some of the grass pitches also became an issue because of shipping problems.</p>\n<p>\n\tBefore the start of the World Cup there was a rainy season and it was followed by the festival season. We had to adjust with all these things, yet could hold it successfully, Krishna said.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tThe reason behind Odishas success, Krishna pointed out, is that the state government worked in close coordination with all National Sports Federations (NSFs).</p>\n\n<p>\n\tWe extend them whatever support the federations need so that all events are hosted successfully, Krishna said.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe senior IAS officer said hosting the U-17 World Cup efficiently wasnt a one-off event for the state government.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe will continue to support football in future. Not to forget the fact that in Odisha, we had earlier hosted the Super Cup, which was played by the top club in the country.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tIn Odisha, the IWL (Indian Womens League) was played, while the age group SAFF tournament was organised here as well.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tThe Odisha FC, which play in the ISL (Indian Super League) is here with us. The states womens football team has been doing well, only recently they finished runners-up in the National Games in Gujarat.</p>\n<p>\n\tWe had strongly been associated with football before and there is no change in our policy. We remain committed to the development of football, said the Secretary of Sports for Odisha.</p>"

        "content": "<p>Former Indian skipper <b>Sourav Ganguly's </b>stint as the country's cricket board (BCCI) president is nearing an end as he has been controversially denied a second term in the governing body by the officials. </p><p>Ganguly's exit, which is also dubbed as an ‘unceremonious one’, has triggered controversies even leading to political ramifications involving the ruling parties of India and the ex-captain's homestate West Bengal - the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Trinamool Congress (TMC) respectively. </p><p>Cutting across the controversy, India Blooms presents some of the important decisions Ganguly took as the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) chief as well as the uncomfortable scenarios that popped up under his three-year tenure. </p><p><h1>Achievements and Highlight of Sourav's tenure </h1></p><p><h2>Day/Night Test</h2></p><p>Ganguly's BCCI was instrumental in hosting the first Day/Night Test (also called Pink Ball Test) in the country. </p><p>Then skipper Virat Kohli's Team India took on Bangladesh and headed for a massive win in the Day/Night Test which was held at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata in Nov 2019. </p><p><h2>IPL amid Covid scare</h2></p><p>When the world was unable to grasp the evolving and fast-changing scenarios after Covid-19 broke out in 2020, the BCCI managed to organise the delayed IPL for that year in Dubai, where the infection rates were far less. </p><p><h2>Domestic cricketers' pay hike</h2></p><p>After assuming the charge of the BCCI, Ganguly had clearly stated that his focus would be on first-class cricket. </p><p>In a significant decision, Ganguly introduced pay hikes for the cricketers who play in the domestic circuit. </p><p><h2>Appointing Rahul Dravid as coach</h2></p><p>Ganguly was instrumental in convincing his former colleague Rahul Dravid to become the men's team's head coach after his predecessor Ravi Shastri stepped down. </p><p>Also VVS Laxman was given the charge of the National Cricket Academy after Dravid quit to become the Team India head coach. Ganguly had played an active role in appointing Laxman to the NCA post as well. </p><p><h2>Record IPL media rights </h2></p><p>The IPL media rights for the period of 2023-2027 were sold at a huge amount of Rs. 48,390 crore, which is the second highest for any sporting event after the United States' National Football League. </p><p>Also, the monopoly of a company in acquiring media rights across platforms was broken with two separate biddings for television and digital media. </p><p>While Star won the television rights for Rs. 23,575 crore, Viacom 18 bagged the digital rights at a bigger amount of Rs. 23,758 crore. </p><p><h2>Women's IPL</h2></p><p>Barely a few weeks ago, the outgoing BCCI president had announced the commencement of the women's IPL, which is likely to begin next year. </p><p>In a letter to the state associations, Ganguly wrote as quoted by various media, 'The BCCI is currently working on the much-awaited Women’s IPL. We are expecting to start the first season early next year.' </p><p><h2>Controversies</h2></p><p>Captaincy issues involving Virat Kohli </p><p>Ganguly's decisions on former skipper Virat Kohli (his stepping down as T20 captain and each other's contradictory remarks on the issue) also earned him the wrath of many in cricketing circles and among Kohli fans. </p><p>Ganguly claimed he had personally requested Kohli not to step down as the T20 skipper, something which the latter contradicted. </p><p><h2>Wriddhiman Saha's allegation</h2></p><p>After getting dropped from the senior men's team, wicketkeeper-batsman Wriddhiman Saha made an explosive claim that Ganguly had assured him of a berth in Team India as long as he remains the BCCI boss. </p><p>The claim had raised questions on whether Ganguly interferes into the team selection, which primarily remains the job of the selection committee. </p><p><h2>Endorsements</h2></p><p>Reports said former BCCI president and Chennai Super Kings (CSK) owner N Srinivasan was one among those who slammed Sourav Ganguly as a board president accusing him of 'nonperformance' and alleging that he had represented brands that were the direct rivals of sponsors of BCCI. </p><p>Ganguly, a common face for multiple brands catering to diverse products, was also slammed by his ex-colleague and Delhi BJP MP Gautam Gambhir for doing surrogate advertising. </p><p><b>’If the BCCI president (Ganguly) is doing it (endorsing fantasy league), you can't expect other players not to do it,’ said Gambhir, who made his international debut under Ganguly's captaincy.</b></p>"

Urgent solutions to this &ldquo;protracted, multifaceted crisis&quot; must be found, he stressed.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Devastating insecurity</strong></p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;People are being killed by firearms, they are dying because they do not have access to safe drinking water, food, healthcare, women are being gang raped with impunity. The levels of insecurity and the dire humanitarian situation have been devastating for the people of Haiti,&rdquo; Mr. T&uuml;rk said.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor the last two months, heavily armed gangs have been blockading access to the country&rsquo;s main fuel terminal and seaports, severely hampering access to drinking water, food and medicine.</p>\n<p>\n\tFood insecurity is on the rise, with a record 4.7 million &ndash; nearly half of the population &ndash; facing acute hunger. Poor sanitation and lack of safe water supplies have led to a so far uncontrolled cholera outbreak.</p>\n<p>\n\tTo date, 2,600 suspected cases of cholera have been reported, half of them children, and claimed dozens of lives.</p>\n<p>\n\tGang violence continues to expand across the capital and in other regions of the country.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Dozens killed</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn just over a week in mid-October, more than 71 people were killed, a dozen women were raped, and hundreds of residents were forced to flee their homes, as a result of turf wars between rival gangs in Croix-des-Bouquets, one of the main communes of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince, according to the Human Rights Service of the UN Integrated Office in Haiti (BINUH).</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Kidnappings and sexual violence by gang members are being used as weapons to inflict severe pain and instil fear among the population,&rdquo; the High Commissioner said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;There is a desperate need to tackle the root causes of inequality and violence, including that have crippled the country&rsquo;s development for decades.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe latest Security Council resolution 2653 (2022) passed last month, establishing a sanctions regime targeting individuals and entities engaging in or supporting criminal activity and violence &ndash; together with a targeted arms embargo - is an important step, said Mr. T&uuml;rk.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Violent response to protests&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tHundreds of thousands of people have been demonstrating since late August to protest against Government policies, the rising cost of living and the increasing insecurity, noted the UN rights office, OHCHR, adding that according to information received, at least 54 people were killed during protests, most of which allegedly because of disproportionate use of force by police officers.</p>\n<p>\n\tPolitical violence has also been documented with the killing of prominent political leaders and journalists.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Police must respect the principles of precaution, necessity and proportionality at all times when using force,&rdquo; said Mr. T&uuml;rk. &ldquo;Prompt, thorough and effective investigations need to be established and those responsible for unnecessary or disproportionate use of force must be held accountable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Suspend forced returns: UNHCR&rsquo;s Grandi</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tIn the light of the crisis, the UN refugee agency on Thursday, called on States in the region and beyond, to suspend the forced return of Haitians to their country.</p>\n<p>\n\tGiven the current situation, &ldquo;I appeal to all States to stand in solidarity with Haiti and urge them not to return Haitians to a country that is extremely fragile,&rdquo; said High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi.</p>\n<p>\n\tHaitian women, children and men who are outside the country and returned to Haiti may face life-threatening security and health risks, and further displacement inside the country.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe forced removal of people to a place where they may face risk of persecution, torture or other serious or irreparable harm would amount to &ldquo;refoulement&rdquo;, which is explicitly prohibited under international refugee and human rights law, UNHCR said.</p>\n<p>\n\tInternational law also prohibits collective expulsions and arbitrary detention associated with it.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>ECOSOC advisory group &lsquo;deeply concerned&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti, which meets under the umbrella of the UN&rsquo;s Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) also issued a statement calling on the international community to urgently support the country&rsquo;s efforts to provide lifesaving aid to those in need.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;We are alarmed that the continuing blockade by armed gangs of roads, ports, and the main oil terminal, will lead to many preventable deaths because of lack of access to clean water and proper sanitation, basic health care and food&rdquo;, said the group of 21 concerned nations.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Pregnant women and their newborns are significantly at risk. Most poor households, already made vulnerable by inflation and low-paying jobs, continue to suffer disproportionately. Alarmingly, hunger has reached a catastrophic level in the capital&rsquo;s Cit&eacute; Soleil neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Group said it welcomed efforts by the Government, with support from the UN as well as other international, national, and local civil society, &ldquo;to address the humanitarian needs of the population and mount an effective cholera response based on the national authorities&rsquo; experience and expertise.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tMembers called for more solidarity with the Haitian people and support for the humanitarian and cholera response in Haiti, including by contributing to the 2022 Haiti Humanitarian Response Plan which has only received 36 per cent of its $373.2 million requirements.</p>",

create space for dialogue and political participation, reduce community violence; secure the delivery of basic services, encourage reconciliation; and promote equal access to justice.  </p>\n<p>\n\tBut quicker and more effective actions are required to address needs and grievances by &ldquo;strengthening a whole-of-society approach and increase investments that build trust, community engagement and cohesion&rdquo;, he asserted. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Women&rsquo;s place </strong></p>\n<p>\n\tNext, Mr. Guterres highlighted that women and youth leadership be bolstered in shaping the future of their countries.   </p>\n<p>\n\tHe acknowledged the &ldquo;pivotal&rdquo;

together with the African Union&rsquo;s 2020 Continental Framework for Youth, Peace and Security &ndash; are important and complementary tools to amplify these critical voices,&rdquo; he said. </p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Important links</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tA more holistic and integrated approach to building resilience and sustaining peace was his third priority.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe top UN official emphasized that this must include &ldquo;tailored investments across the humanitarian-development-peace nexus&rdquo;. </p>\n<p>\n\tFinally, he turned to the lack of financing for prevention and peacebuilding activities, saying that &ldquo;the international community continues to underinvest in peace&rdquo;. </p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;It is time to walk the talk&rdquo;, stressed the UN chief, reminding that the General Assembly&rsquo;s Financing for Peacebuilding resolution reflects a commitment to find increased and more predictable and sustainable funding. </p>\n<p>\n\tHe credited the UN Peacebuilding Fund with providing $150 million to 25 countries in Africa last year, which made it a catalyst for larger contributions by other financial institutions. </p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;But needs far outpace resources&rdquo;, continued the senior official. &ldquo;Funding must be scaled up &ndash; and partnerships with international financial institutions even more strengthened&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Action across sectors</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tUN Assistant Secretary-General for Africa, Martha Ama Akyaa Pobee, highlighted the complementary work of peacekeepers, human rights and humanitarian officials, along with the need for stronger collective action.</p>\n<p>\n\tShe also observed the large burdens carried by women working in conflict zones, maintaining that peace operations embody the opportunity to promote gender equality.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;Step up&rsquo; together</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSpeaking as Chair of The Elders group, independent global leaders who work on tackling conflict and existential threats, Mary Robinson said the Council needed to demonstrate coherence, act in the collective interests of the whole UN, and work more closely with other parts of the Organization.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Now is the time for the Council to step up and speak with one voice&rdquo;, she said adding that &ldquo;only through sustained engagement to tackle the root causes of conflict and build just and sustainable peace&rdquo;

This is unacceptable.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tThe report found that progress on adaptation has been &ldquo;slow and spotty&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tEighty per cent of countries have at least one national adaptation planning instrument, while one-third of the 197 governments that are party to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have incorporated quantified and time-bound targets on adaptation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Financing at issue</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAdditionally, nearly 90 per cent of planning instruments studied display consideration for gender and disadvantaged groups, such as Indigenous peoples.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, financing for these plans remains the sticking point.&nbsp; Estimated adaptation costs are five to 10 times greater than international adaptation finance flows to developing countries, which reached 29 billion in 2020, a four per cent increase over the previous year.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn 2020, combined adaptation and mitigation finance flows fell at least $17 billion short of the $100 billion pledged annually to developing countries.</p>\n<p>\n\tUNEP said a significant scale-up is needed to meet the goal of doubling 2019 finance flows by 2025, as stressed in the outcome of the COP26 global climate conference, held last year in Glasgow, Scotland.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Nations need to back the strong words in the Glasgow Climate Pact with strong action to increase adaptation investments and outcomes, starting at COP27,&rdquo; said Ms. Andersen.</p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, although implementation of adaptation actions &ndash; mainly in agriculture, water, ecosystems and cross-cutting sectors &ndash; is increasing, it is not keeping up with climate impacts and could be outpaced by accelerating climate risks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;No time to lose&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tUnderlining the need for strong political will to increase investments and outcomes, the Secretary-General said that the adaptation gap must be addressed in four critical ways.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The world must step up and protect people and communities from the immediate and ever-growing risks of the climate emergency. We have no time to lose,&rdquo; he warned.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN chief called for dramatically increasing the quantity and quality of financing so that developed countries will achieve the target of doubling support for adaption to $40 billion annually by 2025.</p>\n<p>\n\t&lsquo;At COP27, they must present a credible roadmap with clear milestones on how this will be delivered - preferably as grants, not loans,&rdquo; said Mr. Guterres.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;They must also use their influence as government shareholders of multilateral development banks to prioritize adaptation, resilience and vulnerability.&nbsp; At least half of all climate finance should flow towards adaptation.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;Unblock&rsquo; investment pipeline</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe world urgently needs a new business model for turning adaptation priorities into investable projects, he continued, pointing to the mismatch between what governments propose and what financiers consider as investible.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The investment pipeline is blocked; we must unblock it now. We need a global surge in adaptation investment to save millions of lives from climate carnage.&nbsp; It is high time for unprecedented coordination among recipient governments, development partners and other financiers,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\tRelatedly, the Secretary-General has asked the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the NDC Partnership, and several climate funds to work with public and private financers to pilot a new Adaptation Pipeline Accelerator for targeted countries.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Early warning saves lives</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Guterres highlighted the need for &ldquo;far better climate risk data and information&rdquo;, his third point, which are crucial to protect lives and livelihoods in vulnerable countries and communities.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor his final point, the UN chief stressed the importance of delivering on his appeal for universal early warning systems within five years.&nbsp; He called for providing the financial and technical support required to implement an action plan that the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) will present at COP27.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tWhile these priority areas demand unprecedented international cooperation and support, he also acknowledged that in many places, it is too late for adaptation.</p>\n<p>\n\tTherefore, COP27 must provide a clear and time-bound roadmap on closing the finance gap for addressing loss and damage, an issue that he said will be &ldquo;a central litmus test for success&rdquo; in Egypt.</p>",

Humanitarian organizations have dramatically scaled up their response, but much more must be done, starting with an end to this senseless war,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Unfortunately, we see the opposite, and the destruction caused by strikes at civilian infrastructure, which happens as we speak, is quickly making the humanitarian response look like a drop in the ocean of needs.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Safeguard humanitarian action</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMr. Grandi concluded his remarks by stressing the need for action in four areas, starting with resources.&nbsp; Despite a record level of income, UNHCR is facing a major funding gap in some crucial areas, such as food aid for refugees.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tHe also called for &ldquo;seriously strengthening peacebuilding&rdquo; in fragile countries, for example by reinforcing police, judicial and local government capacity, and overall rule of law.&nbsp; This is critical to both resolve displacement, by allowing refugees to return home, and to prevent conflict from recurring.</p>\n<p>\n\tFor his third point, Mr. Grandi stressed that humanitarian action must be better safeguarded, as threats are increasing, with deadly consequences. Warring parties must protect humanitarian work and enable access to people in need.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Furthermore, everyone must uphold international humanitarian law and contribute to preserving the civilian character of refugee settings &ndash; an increasing challenge in many parts of the world. Armed elements must be separated from refugees, and those displaced and those needing protection must not be conflated with combatants,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Overcome your differences</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe UN refugee chief also presented another side of the duty of care issue, as millions of displaced and vulnerable people are living in areas under the control of non-State actors, or in countries under sanctions.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said no matter how polarised the context, aid workers must be able to operate wherever they are needed, which at times may involve &ldquo;uncomfortable interactions&rdquo; with those who control territory they need access to.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;If I raise this&hellip;it is because we are often forced to negotiate humanitarian carve-outs, as they call them, case by case. I therefore welcome the current efforts in this Council to ensure greater predictability in these matters,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>\n\tHis final point was a call for the international community, and countries on the Council, to overcome their divisions and disagreements &ldquo;at least when you discuss humanitarian issues, and hopefully when you address or strive to address the root causes that are displacing people around the world.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>"

Given the current trajectory of temperature increases, many parts of the world will be uninhabitable within our children&rsquo;s lifetimes, with unimaginable consequences&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\tMr. T&uuml;rk said the injustice being wrought by global warming was now catastrophic: &ldquo;Look at Pakistan, where the recent flooding affected more than 30 million people. It will take years to rebuild and to even begin to understand the fallout from this single disaster.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tHe warned that such disasters were likely to become &ldquo;a recurring nightmare for people across the world if we do not take dramatic, rights-based action to respond to climate change, minimise its impacts, and address the human suffering it has already caused.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>\n\tHe said it was significant that this year&rsquo;s UN Climate Conference, COP27, being hosted by Egypt on the Red Sea coast, was taking place on a continent where millions on the climate change frontline are just victims, not contributors to rising emissions.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The people of Africa are among those suffering the greatest consequences,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Paris principles</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe Paris Agreement makes the need for rights-based climate action clear, the High Commissioner said, calling for all States to respect, promote, and consider their respective human rights obligations when doing so.</p>\n<p>\n\tHe highlighted recent findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that rights-based, participatory climate action leads to more effective, legitimate, and sustainable outcomes for people and the planet.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;To address the biggest challenge of the century, there needs to be a whole-of-society approach,&rdquo; said Mr. T&uuml;rk. &ldquo;It is therefore essential that everyone - including civil society representatives - is able to participate meaningfully at the COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh. Decisions about climate change, including at this meeting, need to be transparent, inclusive and accountable, particularly for those most affected.&rdquo;</p>",

What are you afraid of? I think its because the quiet part that a lot of people dont realise what theyre saying is, We dont want these people who were previously oppressed to get into power because then they may do to us what we did to them.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tDuring his skit, Noah played a clip from radio station LBC during the latest Conservative leadership race a week ago, when a caller falsely claimed Sunak was not even British.</p>\n\n<p>\n\tJavid tweeted in response that the comments from the comedian were so wrong and that Britain is the most successful multiracial democracy on earth and proud of this historic achievement.</p>\n<p>\n\tFormer Tory leadership contender Rory Stewart said Noahs remarks were completely bizarre and an example of lazy stereotyping.</p>\n<p>\n\tDowning Street said Thursday that Sunak did not believe Britain was a racist country.</p>\n<p>\n\tPresenter Piers Morgan also tweeted that US media was falsely portraying Britain as a racist country.</p>\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tNoah finally responded on Friday evening, saying: Cmon Piers, youre smarter than that.</p>\n\n\n\t<p>\n\t\tI wasnt saying The entire UK is racist, I was responding to the racists who dont want Rishi as PM because of his race.

Since the last Every Woman Every Child Progress Report published in 2020, food insecurity, hunger, child marriage, risks from intimate partner violence, and adolescent depression and anxiety have all increased.</p><p>‘Protect the promise’</p><p>The report, titled Protect the Promise, is published by global partners, including the World Health Organization (WHO), UN Children’s Fund UNICEF, the UN sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA, Partnership for Maternal, Newborn & Child Health (PMNCH) and Countdown to 2030, as a bi-annual summary of progress in response to the UN Secretary-General's Every Woman Every Child Global Strategy for Women, Children's and Adolescents' Health.</p><p>An estimated 25 million children were either under-vaccinated or not vaccinated at all in 2021 – 6 million more than in 2019 - increasing their risk of contracting deadly and debilitating diseases.</p><p>Millions of children missed out on school during the pandemic, many for more than a year, while approximately 80 per cent of children in 104 countries and territories experienced learning-loss because of school closures.</p><p>10.5 million lost parents, caregivers</p><p>Since the start of the global pandemic, 10.5 million children have lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19.</p><p>&quotAt the core of our unkept promise is the failure to address the gaping inequities at the root of global crises, from the COVID-19 pandemic to conflicts and the climate emergency&quot, said UN chief António Guterres.</p><p>&quotThe report describes the impacts of these crises on women, children and adolescents, from maternal mortality to education losses to severe malnutrition&quot.</p><p>Sharp decline</p><p>WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said that the COVID pandemic’s &quotlong-term impact on the health and well-being of women, children and adolescents is becoming evident - their chances for healthy and productive lives have declined sharply&quot.</p> <p>&quotAs the world emerges from the pandemic, protecting and promoting the health of women, children and young people is essential for supporting and sustaining the global recovery.&quot</p><p>UNICEF chief Catherine Russell said the pandemic has raised the stakes for all vulnerable communities, and reversed hard-won progress for women, children, and adolescents, &quotbut we are not powerless to change this…By investing in resilient, inclusive primary health care systems, jumpstarting routine immunization programmes, and strengthening the health workforce, we can make sure that every woman and every child can access the care they need to survive and thrive.&quot</p><p>Rights rolled back</p><p>&quotIn the face of increasing political pushback against sexual and reproductive health and rights in many countries, women, children and adolescents today are left without many of the protections of just a decade ago, and many others still have not seen the progress they need,&quot said Dr. Natalia Kanem, UNFPA Executive Director.</p><p>The report provides wide-ranging evidence that children and adolescents face wildly divergent chances of leading a healthy life simply based on where they are born, their exposure to conflict, and the economic circumstances of their families.</p><p>Statistics tell the story</p><p>A child born in a low-income country has an average life expectancy at birth of around 63 years, compared to 80 in a high-income country. In 2020, five million children died before their fifth birthday, mostly from preventable or treatable causes.</p><p>Most maternal, child, and adolescent deaths and stillbirths are concentrated in just two regions – sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.</p><p>More than 45 million children had acute malnutrition in 2020, a life-threatening condition which leaves them vulnerable to death, developmental delays and disease. Nearly three-quarters of these children live in lower-middle-income countries.</p><p>A staggering 149 million children were stunted in 2020. Africa is the only region where the numbers of children affected by stunting increased over the past 20 years, from 54.4 million in 2000 to 61.4 million in 2020.</p><p>The six countries with the highest numbers of internally displaced persons – Afghanistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen – are also among the top 10 food insecure countries.</p><p>A woman in sub-Saharan Africa has around a 130 times higher risk of dying from causes relating to pregnancy or childbirth than a woman in Europe or North America.</p><p>Millions of children and their families are experiencing poor physical and mental health from recent humanitarian disasters in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Somalia, Ukraine and Yemen. In 2021, a record 89.3 million people worldwide were driven from their homes by war, violence, persecution, and human rights abuse.</p><p>The report calls on the global community to address this damaging trajectory and protect the promises made to women, children, and adolescents in the SDGs.</p><p>In particular, it advocates for countries to continue investing in health services, to address all crises and food insecurity, and empower women and young people around the world.</p><p>World Health Summit pledge of $2.6 billion to end polio</p><p>Leaders meeting at the World Health Summit in Berlin on Tuesday, pledged an extra $2.6 billion in funding toward the Global Polio Eradication Initiative’s (GPEI) 2022-2026 Strategy to end polio.</p><p>The historic boost came at an event co-hosted by Germany’s Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), and the funds will support global efforts to overcome the final hurdles to polio eradication.</p><p>The extra cash will help fund vaccination for some 370 million children annually over the next five years, and continue disease surveillance across 50 countries, said WHO in a news release.</p><p>&quotNo place is safe until polio has been eradicated everywhere. As long as the virus still exists somewhere in the world, it can spread – including in our own country. We now have a realistic chance to eradicate polio completely, and we want to jointly seize that chance,&quot said Svenja Schulze, Germany’s Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p><p>Wild poliovirus is endemic in just two countries – Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, after just six cases were recorded in 2021, 29 cases have been recorded so far this year, including a small number of new detections in southeast Africa linked to a strain originating in Pakistan.</p><p>Additionally, outbreaks of polio variants that can emerge in places where not enough people have been immunized - continue to spread across parts of Africa, Asia and Europe, with new outbreaks detected in the United States, Israel and the United Kingdom in recent months.</p><p>&quotThe new detections of polio this year in previously polio-free countries are a stark reminder that if we do not deliver our goal of ending polio everywhere, it may resurge globally,&quot said WHO chief Tedros.</p><p>Image: © UNICEF/ Zahara Abdul</p>"

        "content": "<p>\n\tThe study gives the example of Dhaka, Bangladesh, where under a scenario of very high emissions by 2100, additional deaths due to climate change could rise to nearly twice the country&rsquo;s current annual death rate from all cancers, and 10 times its annual road traffic fatalities.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;Because of human action, the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is reaching dangerous levels, driving Earth&rsquo;s temperatures higher and amplifying the frequency of intensity of extreme events&rdquo;, says the newly launched Human Climate Horizons platform, adding that without concerted and urgent action, climate change will further exacerbate inequalities, and uneven development.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Mortality impacts</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tBuilding on the analyses of 2020, 2021 and 2022 Human Development Reports - and fed by an evolving stream of frontier research - the data shows how climate change can impact people&rsquo;s lives &ndash; from mortality to livelihoods, and energy use.</p>\n<p>\n\tAlthough higher temperatures and a warmer climate put cardiovascular and respiratory systems under stress everywhere, outcomes will vary between places, according to communities that have the resources to adapt and those that do not.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe data shows that climate change could increase mortality rates in Faisalabad, Pakistan by near 67 deaths per 100,000 population &ndash; causing more fatalities than strokes, the country&rsquo;s third leading cause of death.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, however, higher incomes could keep the death toll to 35 per 100,000, which is still deadlier than Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease &ndash; the sixth leading cause of death globally.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Rising temps</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tSince the late 19th century, the earth&rsquo;s average temperature has risen by nearly 1.2&deg;C, changing the entire surface area of the planet, according to the research.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, billions live in regions that have already experienced warming greater than the global average.</p>\n<p>\n\tAs an example, the platform pointed to Maracaibo, Venezuela, noting that in the 1990s it averaged 62 annual days with temperatures exceeding 35&deg;C. However, by mid-century, that number will likely soar to 201 days.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Energy impacts</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tElectricity availability and fuels used to generate it to power air conditioners and heaters, play a crucial role in our ability to cope with extreme temperatures, said UNDP.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe impact of climate change differs across sectors of the economy &ndash; Human Climate Horizons</p>\n<p>\n\tYet, the impacts of climate change on energy use will vary locally, as individuals, communities and businesses adapt to conditions using available resources.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Jakarta, for example, electricity consumption in response to warmer temperatures is projected to increase by roughly one-third of current household consumption in Indonesia. This will require critical additional infrastructure planning.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Labour impacts</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMore frequent and severe temperature extremes also impact livelihoods, affecting the ability to perform tasks and influencing work intensity and duration.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;The impact of climate change differs across sectors of the economy with workers in high-risk, weather-exposed industries like agriculture, construction, mining and manufacturing most affected&rdquo;, according to platform data.</p>\n<p>\n\tIn Niamey, Niger, in sectors such as construction, mining and manufacturing, excessive heat was responsible for 36 fewer working hours annually, taking a 2.5 per cent toll on the country&rsquo;s future GDP.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>Human consequences</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tAs the impacts of climate change are not evenly distributed globally, they will generate a significant uptick in inequalities over the coming years and decades.</p>\n<p>\n\tBut by highlighting that the future is not predetermined, UNDP hopes the information can empower people everywhere, to step up climate action.</p>\n<p>\n\tThe Human Climate Horizons mission is to ensure equal access to data on future impacts, inform decision-making and help everyone understand the human consequences of climate change in different scenarios.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>&lsquo;Logical economic choice&rsquo;</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tMeanwhile, UNDP has also launched the How Just Transition Can Deliver the Paris Agreement report this week, highlighting the need to embrace the &ldquo;green revolution&rdquo; &ndash; or risk increasing social inequality, civil unrest, economic loss.</p>\n<p>\n\tAhead of the UN climate conference, COP27, which kicks off on Sunday in in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, the report spotlights the importance of &ldquo;fair and equitable&rdquo; transitioning to meeting the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement.</p>\n<p>\n\tFrom providing workers with new green economy skills and access to social protection to ensuring that countries lay out a clear pathway to a net-zero future, UNDP chief Achim Steiner said the report provides &ldquo;real-world insights into how to accelerate momentum around a just transition that is fair and equitable for the energy sector and beyond&rdquo;.</p>\n<p>\n\t<strong>A just transition</strong></p>\n<p>\n\tThe report analyses both enhanced short-term climate pledges, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and long-term strategies in which countries lay out plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero.</p>\n<p>\n\tEncouragingly, 72 per cent of nations with enhanced NDCs that refer to a just transition are linking them to socio-economic considerations, while 66 per cent are proposing concrete actions and measures factoring in climate justice.</p>\n<p>\n\tHowever, they fail to make linkages to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or gender equality in either short or long-term climate plans &ndash; missing a significant opportunity, UNDP said.</p>\n<p>\n\t&ldquo;As climate change intensifies and the world faces an immense energy crunch&hellip;decoupling from fossil fuels and investing in the green energy infrastructure of tomorrow&hellip;[is] the only logical economic choice&rdquo;, said Mr. Steiner.</p>"
